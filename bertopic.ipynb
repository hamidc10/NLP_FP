      "A great tool for working with Snow Crab legs! More powerful, yet more tactile than the stainless steel type. I was always cracking the claws too aggressively with those and leaving a lot of shell shards to peel off. With this orange boy I can put just the right amount of pressure to let me crack the shell and get to the chunk of deliciousness inside. I wish I had gotten more of these. Everyone wants to use it and I don't like waiting to get my cracker back when I'm in Snow Crab mode.\n",
      "We just moved to Florida and my husband is constantly coming home with crab that he catches. Pliers don't work so well, duh, so I got on line and found these. Husband came home with 25 crabs and the Zyliss seafood cracker and OXO pickers arrived on the same day. I wasn't sure what to expect, but they worked excellent. Highly recommend!\n",
      "Works good.  Product as described\n",

      "Couldn't ask for more!\n",

      "This table would be great for so many things, but my use for it may be a little unique. I have a new baby that I am currently breast feeding. She eats constantly with maybe 30-40 minutes between feedings and also hates it when she is not being held. For the first seven weeks I was getting dehydrated because I would be sitting on the couch and it was so difficult to reach the coffee table to eat or drink without breaking her latch and having her get all feisty or waking her up if she actually fell asleep on me. I also couldn't figure out how to use the computer without getting in a horrible position that would kill my back by the end of the day. This table lets me keep everything close by. Unlike other tables of this type that stay at couch cushion height, this one can also sit up high flat or angled so I'm not always using my back and neck to look down. I can pay my bills, write product reviews lol, eat and drink, etc... I am not crazy about the metal wood-grain design, but for the price that is what I was expecting. I wish they would make this table out of wood. It does look like it would be possible. I love that it folds down so I can store it on the side of the couch and it only takes up a couple inches of space. There is no bar across the bottom to get in the way of extending your feet or using an ottoman. If you are using the table for this purpose I would also recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/My-Brest-Friend-Deluxe-Pillow-Light-Green/dp/B000HZI1R2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green</a>&nbsp;for hands free feeding and more back support and height than the Boppy.

      "this is an inexpensive TV table to purchase. It is for our mother who eats at least one meal in her chair.  It slides easily across the floor/carpet and fits her just right for eating her meal.\n",
      "Good quality and very stable.\n",
      "We bought this table in order to have a space to put our laptop on instead of using lap desks.  It works well and the surface is large.  I can usually fit my laptop, drink and remote control here.  Seems pretty stable as well.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it looks a bit cheaper than I expected.  You can definitely tell the top is painted plastic.\n",
      "This tray was ordered to use as a small laptop computer desk.  The adjustable height works well, as does the under-furniture design.  The top is plastic, but thick enough to be rigid and sturdy for lightweight use.  The frame is metal and seems to be adequate.  It would make a great TV tray, but shouldn't be used for heavy objects.\n",
      "this does everything you could want it to do...the ONLY reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that i can't sanitize it with alcohol ( it destroys the finnish and wood grain coating )...yes i know, i'm picky...don't hesitate to get this table\n",
      "I couldn't be happier with the cracker. I have had a number of different ones, but this is the best of all.\n",
      "2nd one I've purchased - I don't think you can find anything any better. I'm a big fan of all things made by Zyliss\n",
      "We use these all the time!! Ordered 4 and used them all summer. Lots of compliments on looks and function. I hate anything plastic but these are so high quality they are nicer than metal ones.\n",
      "Amazingly solid for a plastic cracker.  Took down a 3 lb lobster like a champ.\n",
      "Nice lobster shell cracker. The handles are comfortable. The red color helps anyone easily locate in a draw filled with utensils.\n",
      "Used on stone crab claws and worked perfectly.\n",
      "I lover snow crab legs and these are perfect for them.  I had a metal cracker with removable rubber grips that worked but was rusting beneath the rubber grips.  So the all-plastic handles were a plus for me.  These work very well on multiple sizes of snow crab legs.  The work on large flat legs, the hard round legs and the claws.  I noticed one reviewer mentioned that they didn't work well on king crab legs and just punched holes in the legs.  I can see how this would be true for such large legs but I can assure you these are just right for snow crab legs.\n",
      "The best cracker.\n",
      "These work great on crabs. I am not sure they would be that suited for use on lobsters however.\n",
      "wonderful\n",
      "Best cracker ever.\n",
      "this is the worst thing i have ever bought through amazon...not amazon's fault, but it's the manufacturer' error.\n",
      "it's wobley, it's not level (the top), it's just a piece of crap.  save your money.\n",
      "Just what we needed.\n",
      "works well and the hand grip is not to thick as I have a small hand. washes well in dishwasher\n",
      "ok\n",
      "Awesome product!!!\n",
      "Best lobster crackers around\n",
      "This cracker is very inexpensive; however, it is the best I've ever seen. It cracked lobster claws as well as snow crab claws without any problems.\n",
      "I think TV trays are a little better but it works just fine.  It's light weight but it doesn't fold down.  Once you get together it stays together but I just put mine in another room when not in use.\n",
      "I primarily bought this because I was looking for an inexpensive folding table.  I don't need it to hold more than a plate of food or my laptop, but the problem is that it's really flimsy.  In fact, the wire that keeps it propped open will sometimes randomly unhinge, leaving your food and/or laptop to crash to the floor.  Also, the flimsiness causes the table to bounce as I type.  I'm not a super jovial typist or anything.  For the price though...it's not too terrible.\n",
      "I use this for laptop work, hand writing work and sewing. It works well. I wish it would slide under my chair better.\n",
      "The table is usable and I appreciate having a surface to work and eat from when I sit on the sofa. Yes it is a bit on the flimsy and cheaply-made side, but it will serve my purpose. I just want folks to know what they are getting. Keep a check on your expectations.\n",
      "Planned to by a  number of these, but bought two to try out.  Easy to put together and folds up just fine, but if you put any pressure on the tray, it will bounce.  The product would be fine if there was some way to brace the top.  I do not intend to purchase any more of this product.\n",
      "It works on large or king crab legs very well, on small crab legs not so well as to be expected. I'd recommended this to anyone that doesn't want to bite the shell.\n",
      "I like these over the metal types.  Work just as well and clean up is easier.  They still look as good as the day I bought them.\n",
      "At least for the table. (If I'm breaking down a lobster in the kitchen, then I'll simply use the back of a heavy chefs knife.) NOTE that any lobster over 2 Lb will require a hammer, not a cracker. 4 Lb and up, a hand maul. However all this only applies to the claws. The tail, even of a large lobster, doesn't require a tool of any kind.\n",
      "This cracker is lightweight, easy to use with buttery hands, and with it's red color, it's easy to find at an outdoor picnic. Be careful of most crackers as many are either useless or difficult to use. One that particularly comes to mind is a stupid design in the shape of a lobster claw. Sure, it's really cute...until you actually try to use them, which when you find out they cut into your hands at the slightest pressure.\n",
      "Since most restaurants have chintzy tools, when eating out in NYC I'd bring my own Zyliss cracker and a Global seafood pick -- the best ones out there, along with a pair of Joyce Chen scissors. However, if you don't want to drop the $$$ for the Global, then Zyliss makes a decent set of picks. The part to pay attention to is the \"claw\". Some brands are so smooth as to be useless.\n",
      "You'll find that a good set of picks are only minimally useful on lobster (mostly the joints), but they're essential for King or Snow Crab -- even Maryland crab.\n",
      "FYI, most people who live outside New England are at a loss at how to take a lobster apart. More expensive restaurants will do it for you, but where's the fun in that? Instead, check You Tube for videos on how to do it -- there are a bunch. Now, I just have to decide how to best take advantage of my chain Supermarket Lobster Sale...$4.99 Lb.\n",
      "Convenience little table for my laptop. Cheap material but serve the purpose.  The table does tilt a little but it is fine once you have something sit on top of it.  Would not recommend putting any heavy items or Hot liquid. The table is very light and might fall apart if holding too much weight.  Overall, I would give it a 4 for the price and handy table.\n",
      "The whole top of this table is plastic, but it's got a grain finish to make it look more realistic.  assembly was no problem and it is adjustable to a variety of heights.  nice part is is folds flat to store under the couch.  Not as sturdy as I had hoped -- my husband puts his laptop on it to do some work from home, but it's a little wobbly.\n",
      "This is a great tray because it slides it toward you making it much more comfortable to use. I like the wood look. Shipped very fast. Great transaction\n",
      "This has been a wonderful set of table I ordered  for ourselves and enyoyed them so much, we ordered a set for our son and his wife for Christmas!\n",
      "It is what I thought.... Was hoping quality would be better. Service was great. Style is perfect. Would buy it again...\n",
      "Work very well and glad that I got them. Thanks Amazon.com for your great service. Now I don't have to use a toothpick to get the meat out. lol\n",
      "Sturdy and Great for harder shells like crab claws. For snow crab legs with softer shells I would use a sea sheller/cutter. I  have yet to try it to shell nuts, etc.\n",
      "The cracker hinge snapped when working its second 1.5 lbs lobster ever.  I live on the coast in New England, not cool.\n",
      "Solid crackers, bring them to your local indian casino and crack crab legs LIKE A BOSS. Just don't forget them there like I did :(\n",
      "I was concerned when I saw the Zyliss online because of the plastic. I thought they might not be strong enough or too flimsy for seafood. Over the years we've had good luck with other Zyliss products so I decided to give these a change. Tonight they cracked dungeness crab with easy, even the claws.\n",
      "\n",
      "I only bought one pair to test, but all four of liked the wide body, it kept the crab shell more intact in big pieces than a bunch of little shards, the teeth gripped for a good hold on the crab and cracking the crab was easy, even for me with my arthritis. We will be ordering more of these so we can all sit around the table with our own crab cracker, great product.\n",
      "It really looked good on TV and on line but is wobbles and is very weak and unstable.  I do not recommend it.\n",
      "I can't believe this item got good reviews. It's plastic tray, metal legs wire is so cheaply made I was very disappointed. And to pay $40.00 for it makes me mad at myself for ordering it. Stay away from this tray. There is no quality here.\n",

I do like it and would give it a five if it would lay flat on my cooking surface or if I could talk to the company and see what we could do to fix this.\n",

I heat at high on gas stove with oil or butter, a few minutes to get it hot then lower the burner to medium heat and add my eggs.  Hint if you like over easy try putting a clear cover over the pan, I use one from my pots, to allow steam to cook the surface.

      "AVOID USE OF SOAP TO CLEAN THESE PANS FOLLOW MANUFACTURE INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLEANING.  I use both a Lodge cast iron scrapper in addition to sea salt to clean the pans.  If you burn food the best solution is to then use soap and a lot of scrubbing to remove it and re season the pan.  I also season the pans with a light coating of Lard yes i did say lard and put on burner to get it to smoke then cut it off and later wipe the excess off. I have yet to have anything stick doing this.\n",

      "I was VERY excited to get one of these for Christmas but unfortunately, I have not had the success that others have had at making it a non-stick pan.  I was able to get the beeswax off following the procedure that many on here suggested.  I then seasoned it by using oil and heating in a hot oven for an hour, then allowing it to cool.  I repeated that 4 or 5 times.  After this extensive process, the pan appeared to have a smooth non-stick surface.  But when I went to make scrambled eggs, the bottom and sides of the pan ended up coated with stuck-on egg.  It took a lot of scrubbing with a nylon brush to get the egg off and in the process, I think some of the seasoning chipped off because the pan no longer had a smooth surface.\n",
      " I emailed the company for help or suggestions, but got no response.\n",
      "\n",
      "I then decided to strip the pan and re-season it using the method recommended by Cook's Illustrated.  While the eggs stuck a LITTLE bit less than before, a good portion of the bottom of the pan still had a layer of cooked egg stuck to it.  At this point, I think I'm done with this pan.  I'll try a carbon steel pan from another company, but I'm done with buying pans from Mauviel, mainly because of their lack of response to my request for help.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am envious of all of the other people who were able to successfully season this pan.\n",
      "Season it - clean it properly. So much better than any non-stick pan out there. Take some time and Learn how to use it. Changes the way you cook. Recommend for a gas stove that allows you to better control the heat. Invest in a cheap IR Thermometer - surface temp for eggs is 325 deg  - try to regulate that on a flat top electric.\n",
      "Carbon steel I love it! Cast Iron is great but takes so long to heat up. This nice thick M'steel pan heats up quick and sears steaks like nothing else. Season it up properly and you will love it. Seasoned mine with very light coatings of grapeseed oil about 12 times check out the pic. Cooks like a champ! I gotta get a bigger one now.\n",
      "If you take the time to properly season this pan you will be throwing out your Teflon pan. Just so you know, the instructions that come with the pan tell you to rinse the bees wax coating off with very warm water. I don't know how warm that waters got to be but nothing that comes out of my tap was hot enough to remove it. However, an hour in a 200 degree oven followed by a rinse with boiling water and a quick wipe the pan was ready to season.\n",
      "\n",
      "I used the same method to season this pan as Ive used on all my cast iron. Warm the pan for about 20 minutes in the oven at 200 degrees. Cover every surface of the pan including the handle with a little Crisco. Then wipe as much as possible off the pan with a lint free cloth. Pop it back into a 300 degree oven for 30 minutes then wipe it out again. Finally return the pan to the oven at 400 degrees for two hours. Shut off the heat and leave the pan in the oven to cool slowly at least two more hours. I repeated this process two more times. After the third time I gave it a test run by cooking a cheese omelette. It slid around the pan every bit as well as it did in my Teflon pan whos  coating is starting to bubble up. It heats up fast and evenly. A hot water rinse, a good wipe to dry and a few drops of oil wiped over the pan and its ready for next time.\n",
      "Nice pan. A bit heavier than I expected but no big deal. The quality seems quite good, it seasoned very well too. I own a few 1950 - something Griswold cast iron pans and thought I knew how to season a pan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just for kicks, before I seasoned this pan I researched the subject further and saw many references to using flaxseed oil and the \"Vollrath method\". This is truly the way to go, though rather than using my crappy electric stovetop, I used my oven. The pan is very well seasoned and I actually re-did my Griswolds using flaxseed oil and the same method. Quite pleased.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a side note, Mauvial apparently does not offer lids for these frying pans, at least none that I could find for the 14\" pan. We have a Wasserstrom Restaurant Supply here locally. I visited today and found a lid that fit this pan quite well. Coincidentally, it is made by Vollrath (I have absolutely no affiliation with the company). The part number on the lid is 67541. I imagine it's easily ordered online from either Amazon or someone else. Happy cooking!\n",
      "Received my pan promptly, packaged well. Tried the hot water wax removal but wound up putting it in the oven on warm, turned upside down on a baking tray covered with parchment. Easy wipe off after 5 minutes. Its just a tad smallest than i hoped, bottom measures 7, brim to brim it is 8. Will take that into account when ordering one to replace my 10 cast iron heavyweight.\n",

      "A necessary addition for every kitchen.\n",
      "Even though I didn't season it very well (electric range) food does not stick.  I would suggest seasoning it in the oven like some reviewers did if you have an electric range.  It will give a more even coating.\n",
      "Washing is easy, just hot water (NO soap).  Or wipe with a piece of paper towel.\n",
      "Struggled with SS and non stick both for years as an accomplished home chef and didn't know these existed. I went from german knives to carbon steel Japanese knives a few years ago and when i stumbled on these I knew I had to have one....no regrets. Make sure you get the wax off before seasoning by putting in a warm oven (200F) and wiping with towels several times. Not sure that Mauviel is any better than other French made fry pans out there but this is nice.\n",
      "I have had this pan for a while now and have seasoned according to instructions but it does not keep eggs from sticking no matter what type of oil I use.  I have went through the process of seasoning it at least 3 times now but it still doesn't keep food from sticking.  I don't recommend buying this one.  There doesn't seem to be any pans out anymore that one can make a nice egg in.\n",
      "Had to return this to Amazon. Followed the instructions perfectly to prepare it for the first use.  First, you use hot water to remove the wax coating that covers the entire pan.  However, under the wax coating, on the outside of the pan, there was an entire row of rust along 1/2 of the pan.  I contacted the company - 2 calls - before returning it to Amazon. I left a voicemail with their Customer Care representative and spoke to another person who said she would give my message to the person in charge of returning customer calls, but have still not heard back.  We have heard terrific things about Mauviel pans and wanted to try the carbon steel. Possibly this was a quality control issue, but it would be helpful if Mauviel would return out calls.\n",
      "i seasoned the skillet and it is now nonstick... nice! it only  took me 2 tries.\n",
      "This was my first carbon steel saut pan and I love it.  Follow the cleaning and seasoning directions very carefully and you will have a stick free surface for the life of the pan.\n",
      "I love the way it cooks but it does have a little low point in the center -- and it looks terrible.  You can sear food at very high heat and nothing sticks.  I need to try and treat it again as there are many scratches on the pan, in spite of only using only non-metal spatulas.  Treating it initially was a mess as the canola oil I used turned to a yellow, sticky mess, and the directions Mauviel provides does not result in an even black surface.\n",
      "Great skillet!  Followed reviewers instructions about removing beeswax in the ovenworked like a charm!  Then did the potato, salt, and oil routine to season. (Didnt want my oven on for hours in the NC summer!) Result was perfect! (Doesnt look beautiful, but who cares!)  Had to try an easy-over egg (at ten oclock at night!) just to see if it worked!  Voila!  No sticking!  Ridding myself of my other non stick skillets immediately. I had to give away my 10 cast iron skillet because it was just to heavy for my senior citizen arthritic hands.  The Mauviel skillet is much easier to handle. Highly recommend!\n",
      "Not loving it.  I have experience cooking with cast iron, stainless steel, and other types of cookware.  This is my least favorite.  I have seasoned it, but it is definitely not non-stick in the way I was looking for it to be.  I can't return it because I already seasoned it (I'm assuming) , and at this point, I'm not sure I'm even going to keep it.  To the company's defense, it may just be that carbon steel (or m' steel) isn't for me, but I feel like I just crumpled 30+ dollars and threw it in my trash can.  To the commenters who are going to try to 'teach' me now to use it:  I have read all reviews, instructions, tutorials... it's not that I didn't do it right, it's just not a great cooking surface for me.  I know some will say to give it time, but I really don't feel as if I want to frustrate myself further...  Thank you, though...\n",
      "I am extremely confused why my pans will not stau seasomed.  Tried different ways, but the results are all the same.  I wish i never bought these pans.  Disappointed\n",
      "I returned it because I couldn't find a cover that fit.\n",
      "This was my first Mauviel carbon steel pan, but I own several De Buyers already.  I must say, I really like this one and might actually recommend it to most people over the De Buyers.\n",
      "\n",
      "This pan is a little thinner than the De Buyers, but just barely.  It's still sturdy and heavy and will retain heat, just not quite as perfectly.  I can imagine for some uses people would prefer De Buyer, and actually in the very large sizes I might recommend De Buyer (or the Mauviel paella pan, if it's thicker, not sure), because unless your burner is huge having the thicker material will make the large pan heat more evenly.  For 11\" and less, I'd recommend the Mauviel because it's a little more responsive to heat changes and it's a little lighter, making it better for eggs and for tossing vegetables, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "As some reviewers have noted, the handle on mine was a little bit rough at the edges when I first got the pan.  I sanded it down using one of those diamond-coated steel knife sharpening blocks, but I think any sanding paper would probably do fine. This isn't a necessity, it's not sharp or anything, I'm just a perfectionist.  I note this because I think Mauviel could do better at sanding down the corners themselves in the future.  It took me about 5 minutes though, so not a big deal, and then I seasoned the handle with a very very thin layer of oil to help protect from rust since I'd exposed a little bare metal along the edges.  All that being said, the handle is actually one of my favorite parts of this pan and I hope Mauviel never changes it (other than to just sand down the corners a little haha).  De Buyer has been driving me crazy with their new handles.  The silicone one on the new Mineral line sometimes gets sticky in the oven and then trapped particles of my dish rag or something.. I'm not sure, but the point of a steel pan is to have a plain steel handle that can go in the oven without thinking twice. Mauviel captures this perfectly (so do my older De Buyers, for what that's worth).\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I wanted to note that customer service for Mauviel has been very responsive to my (perfectionist) inquiries about the material of the rivets.  I got an answer, and it's stainless steel, which is great.  I was confused because the rivets weren't the same material as the rest of the pan, but the customer service person talked to the warehouse head and got me an answer very quickly.  So, here's to good customer service!  I'm planning to buy one of the deeper Mauviel saute pans in the 11\" size next and can't wait.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I think this pan really embodies the essence of a french carbon steel pan - it's extremely, extremely versatile and will last forever.  It's beautiful and it's very fun to cook with.  The 11\" size is perfect for most uses in my two-person household and is my most frequently used pan.  I have a smaller De Buyer that I use for eggs, frying spices, or cooking a single steak sometimes so I'd recommend the 9.5\" size as well if you don't have something comparable.  Larger pans will harder to manage with one hand or to toss food with.  I actually have a 14\" De Buyer carbone plus paella pan (very similar to Mauviel paella pan from what I can tell), and that's been good as a \"large\" pan because it's easier to wash and fits in the oven well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final note in this long review - it took me a very long time to understand the \"non-stick\" properties of carbon steel and cast iron.  It really has more to do with cooking technique than the material itself, unlike teflon.  Google how to \"season\" stainless steel pans and how to cook with them and you'll be well on your way to \"non-stick\" cooking. The carbon steel IS a lot less sticky than stainless, but the techniques are similar for reducing sticking - they just work better on carbon steel basically.  A lot of it has to do with having the pan hot enough first, so that it creates a steam-layer or else seals the food fast enough to prevent sticking.  If your food is really wet, it cools the pan down and get more a \"steamed\" exterior to the meat or vegetable your cooking (which also sticks more). So it helps to dry things off a bit before tossing them in.  Don't add too much to the pan, either (at least not all at once), since that also cools it off.  Thicker pans seem more \"non-stick\" because they hold heat better, but a lot of this is just technique.  As I've learned more, I've managed to cook all sorts of things without them sticking.  if things stick, look at your technique though - not your seasoning.  It doesn't need to be black and perfect for it to work.  For instance, if you're trying to get potatoes not to stick, I find it helps to rinse and briefly soak them first to get off extra starch that would otherwise make a sticky layer on the bottom of the pan, but be SURE to dry them after (see above note) so they don't cool down the pan and stick anyway.  The water also mixes with the starch and creates a sticky residue, and having them dryer helps reduce this.  Stir, shake, or toss every few minutes when you first add them until the potatoes get hot on all sides, then turn the heat a bit lower so they don't burn and just shake the pan every once in a while to turn them.  Finishing them in the oven works well too, for thicker pieces of potato, or if you're cooking a bunch at once.  Anyway, all of this is to say \"don't freak out about the seasoning\" - that's not what makes them non-stick, it's 99% about technique.  It does help to have a little oil in the pores of the metal, which is why Mauviel's instructions have you heat oil in the pan for 5 minutes when you first get it.  It won't blacken the pan, but it'll help prevent sticking.  If it starts to stick again later, clean the pan really well (use soap and a rough sponge, I don't care, and then do this oil soak thing again).  It's like seasoning stainless in that sense - the black patina may help and make it better, but you can cook potatoes on day one if your technique is good and you follow the instructions for an initial seasoning on day one.  I do like to season the outside of the pan with a few extremely thin layers of oil to make it blacken (for looks) and prevent rust, but I let the inside's seasoning develop with time from cooking.  Don't worry if a bit of it comes off too from making a pan sauce - it comes and goes and that's normal (like in a wok).  The residue is inert as far as I can tell and won't hurt you or change the flavor of things. I think it's basically just tiny particles of burnt food.  I wouldn't boil down something acidic for a long time (like simmering tomato sauce), but a simple pan sauce is totally fine.\n",
      "I ordered this pan and returned another (unnamed) brand for a couple of reasons.  First, it's about a pound lighter.  Still heavy, but much more manageable.  Second, I was somewhat concerned with the 'too many to count' Amazon feedbacks reporting how difficult it was to remove the protective coating.  There were several of the same for the Mauviel pan but not nearly as many.  And to those, I wanted to share how I removed the beeswax coating quite easily:  I placed a large stockpot full of boiling water in the kitchen sink.  Ladled the boiling water several times over the back of the pan first, softening the wax coating.  It wiped clean with paper towels.  Repeated the process with the front of the pan... again, it easily wiped clean with paper towels.  The coating on the handle wasn't quite as easy... still a bit tacky even after soaking it in the boiling water (tacky enough that the paper towels stuck to it. Ugh).  So I placed it in a 350 degree oven on a sheet pan covered with parchment paper for 20-30 minutes.. The remaining residue came clean with the wipe of a dish towel.  Of course it goes without saying, you are dealing with boiling water and a very hot metal pan here, so please be careful.  Overall it was pretty easy.  Hope the seasoning process goes as well.\n",
      "Very well made and only a couple of dollars  more than the not even close competition.\n",
      "After a couple of hours of seasoning it correctly (not like the instructions), it's 100% non-stick!\n",
      "a little big for me lol, great quality.\n",
      "Terrible product. Arrived with a sticky coating around entire pan.  Was very difficult to remove. Pan not very stick-free.\n",
      "it took me one hour to get the bee was off but I just let it sit in hot water in the bathroom sink and then I peeled off the wax it was very hard to get off it is all over top bottom just everywhere but finally I got it all off I even used a non scratch pad to help get it off it was a job but then I just washed it with soap and then I made my creps did a nice job don't clean till it is cooled but nice  very satisfied no work any more no probblems but must follow exact directions and it is all good\n",
      "Perfect crepes! I've never made crepes -ever- but even the first crepe made with this pan was perfect. It's seasoning up nicely, too. I don't have prior experience with black steel, but I am pleased with the ease of care of this pan. I've even made perfect omelettes with this, too.\n",
      "I have an older 9.5\" Mauviel crepe pan.  On that pan the metal is thick(doesn't warp), the handle is riveted, and balance is great.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want a second pan to double the speed of my crepe making, but Mauviel is off the list now.\n",
      "\n",
      "These new pans are a disgrace.  Spot welds(!), and I read reviews about the pan's warping.  Spot welds are notoriously unreliable.  As the pan heats and cools the welds break.  I've had it happen many times over the years on various pans and buy only riveted pans now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mauviel, what, did you move production to China?  Or just adopt Chinese manufacturing practices?  Disgraceful.\n",
      "THIS IS A GREAT PAN! JUST FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO SEASON AND PRESTO IT IS NON STICK. YOU HAVE TO BE PATIENT TAKING OFF THE BEES WAX BUT IT IS WELL WORTH IT. IT TOOK ME ABOUT 2.5 HOURS FOR THE WHOLE PROCESS, BUT THE END RESULT WAS SMOOTH. I WILL BE GETTING A LOT OF USE OUT OF THIS PAN. DON'T HESITATE, JUST BUY IT! I AM ONE HAPPY CAMPER.\n",
      "I have $300 copper cookware, but I find myself going for this pan more often. It makes an incredible omelet!\n",
      "The beeswax is a pain but the pan is excellent. Excellent quality and cooking performance. Lesson Learned  - Put the pan in the oven around 225 on a sheet pan to melt the wax for 15 min or so.\n",
      "First you have to get the wax off. Bake the pan in a 200 F oven for 20 minutes or so. I put mine on a cookie sheet with lots of paper towels, which saved a lot of mess. Then I scrubbed it and put it back in the 200 oven. After another 20 minutes it was wax-free.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since it was already at 200, I rubbed it with flax-seed oil, all over, including the handle. I rubbed off most of the oil with another paper towel. I put it back in the oven and turned it up to 550 F. Left it for an hour. Turned off the oven and let it cool fully for several hours. When I took it out, the pan was a beautiful dark brown color and seemed sort of non-stick. I repeated this process several times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I used the pan. I fried chicken and bacon. I sauteed spinach. Nothing stuck badly, but the beautiful finish didn't hold up. Within a week, 15% of my new, hard-won seasoning had flaked or chipped off. Did I make the oil too thick? I don't know and I didn't give up.\n",
      "\n",
      "I repeated the seasoning steps. I heated the pan to 200, rubbed it with more flaxseed oil, wiped off as much oil as I could, put it back in the oven at 550, and left it there for more than an hour. When the baking on was done, I turned off the oven and let it cool slowly overnight. I have a well-insulated Chambers oven, and it probably took 4+ hours to fully cool down each time. I did this many times, over and over. It took a long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "After 8 more seasoning processes, my pan is quite non-stick. I can scramble and fry eggs. All meats and fish work well; I can sear steaks and not lose any goodness. No matter the temperature, nothing sticks. I often brush the hot pan with a little fresh coconut oil on a paper towel before I add food. I don't use this pan for acidic foods like tomato sauce, or boiling liquids, ever. It finally, after all this work, works just like people say. It is perfect and I would never part with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I scrub the pan with a soft scrubby or chainmail and hot water and dry it immediately. I rarely use soap and never use steel wool. I don't use salt either.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great pan and I love mine. It works well with my induction burners as well as huge flames and high temperatures. The bottom is perfectly flat, unlike many carbon steel pans that cost much, much more. It is a joy to use in every way. Was it worth all the trouble? I don't think about that any more, this pan is part of my life.\n",
      "Works great once you have it seasoned properly.\n",
      "It's taken a long while to break this sucker in.  Eggs every day, and I'm now finally at a point when they slide around without ever touching them with a spatula.  Great heat uniformity, however, and a lovely finish on it.  I use it every day, so it's paid off.\n",
      "This pan becomes better and better as it is used.  It is virtually non stick now...I've had it about 2 months.\n",
      "I've never owned cast iron or carbon steel pans before but I want to get away from chemically treated pans, so I bought this one. I research a lot of seasoning instructions, and settled on heating the pan at 500 degrees on parchment paper, covered in a thin layer of vegetable oil. Flaxseed oil seems unnecessary since all you really need is unflavored oil. I baked the pan for 1 hour, letting it cool down in the oven slowly without opening the oven door. After the pan was cool, I repeated the cycle once more. This is after twice baking off the wax and cleaning the pan thoroughly first, of course. It worked very nicely, and the pan is now largely non-stick. It's a bit more work to get it clean since you have to re-oil it each time you use it, but that only takes a minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "For any other novices out there: I learned to cook in this pan at a lower temperature, and that you can turn the heat off sooner than you might think since the pan holds the heat for a long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update: After using it for a while now, I still think this does a reasonably good job of cooking food, and if it truly lasts for decades without giving me cancer causing toxins, it's going to be well worth the money. I see no reason why it wouldn't. It isn't as non-stick as some seem to claim so I have to be careful with things like eggs, but with a little oil and careful temperature control (experimentation pays off), it's pretty close. I suspect it gets better as the patina builds up over time.\n",
      "I love this baby! As soon as it arrived, I seasoned it and began using it. Eggs just slide right off, and crepes are perfect\n",
      "Mauviel, c'est toujours de trs bonne qualit!\n",
      "So much prep work for what I hoped for\n",
      "Received the 12.5\" pan as a gift (purchased off amazon).  First, the 12.5\" is big and heavy.  That is good for me, but if you concerned about the heft, I might go a size or two smaller.  I also agree with many on here that the wax is hard to get off.  I found that even hot water made it hard to get off.  Finally, I put the oven to 200 degrees and would throw it in there for a few minutes until glossy, then use paper towels to wipe off as much as I could.  After about 3 rounds of that, I scrubbed it with hot water, a little soap, and a stiff brush.  One thing to note--the handle has wax on it too.  I thought it had a different coating on it (like a light silicone coat), but when I seasoned it in the oven the first time it came out black and seasoned instead of grey.  Not an issue since it doesn't touch food and it won't rust with the wax/grease seasoned on there, but learn from my mistake.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you do research on seasoning, it can be overwhelming.  I think the key at least for initial seasoning is to use very thin coats (put a few drops in, and then wipe it all out with paper towels) and to heat it up and then let it cool completely.  I would heat my oven to 500 degrees with the pan in it, take it out, oil and wipe, then place it in the oven upside down for 1 hour, turn the oven off after the hour, and leave it in the oven to cool completely.  I started off with flaxseed oil for the first 3 rounds  I didn't get a black finish--more of a deep bronze.  I then started alternating between crisco and flaxseed for another three rounds.  I have seen some pans that come out a flawless and evenly coated black.  Mine is not perfect...it is a very deep bronze, and there are some streaks here and there, but the finish is smooth and shiny like glass. I fried an egg and moved around like a air hockey puck.  After I cook with it, I rinse out out, dry it on the stove, and then spray some pam in it and wipe it out.  It will continue to really season as you cook with it like cast iron.\n",
      "\n",
      "This pan is amazing and I am very happy.  Definitely a great buy and something that with proper upkeep will only get better with age.\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE:  I still love this pan.  However, I was not very pleased with the flaxseed seasoning.  It will flake, especially if you cook anything acidic in it.  I got some rust where it flaked, so I stripped it with oven cleaner and am reseasoning with Crisco.  I know a lot of people love flaxseed because you get a very attractive dark seasoning.  But it doesn't hold up well and I would recommend Crisco.  I know some others recommend grapeseed oil, which I may try, but Crisco is cheap and available.\n",
      "I love this pan. A few months back I thought I would give carbon steel pans a go. I am glad I did. This is my go to pan for anything that will fit. Seared scallops, check. Eggs, check. A filet minion for one, check. I loved it so much, I bought two more, the 9.5\" and the 12\". My heavy cast iron is now down the garage with the camping stuff, and my former favorite All Clad Stainless are in the back of the cupboard. These are so easy to use, after seasoning, nothing sticks. Don't wash with dish soap, just hot water and sometimes a plastic dish brush, and I dry with a paper towel - that's it. Even my wife (who doesn't cook) likes them, made a sunny side up egg, and she just slid if off the pan on to her plate. She was thrilled. Overall a great pan if cared for properly.\n",
      "Great pan!  I've been a cast iron user for years, and this steel pan provides many benefits and attributes of Cast Iron while being smoother and lighter.  Think a wok, but a little bit thicker.  Heats quickly; stays hot; can be finished in the oven.  Naturally non-stick if you season and clean it the right way (which is easy).\n",
      "If seasoned correctly you'll never need to buy another pan...ever.\n",
      "I don't understand what all the fuss is about in regard to seasoning this 8\" pan.  I received my pan a couple of days ago and based on some of the reviews I wasn't sure what to do.  I read the instructions regarding removing beeswax from pan and did exactly as directed.  The beeswax came off after two cycles of pouring boiling water over skillet and wiping down with paper towels to remove wax residue.  I then placed vegetable oil in skillet and let heat for 5 minutes and my pan was like ice...smooth and nonstick.  I fried eggs in it this morning and the eggs moved like they were on ice.  I am ordering the 14\".  I will put the 14\" in the oven to remove beeswax.  These pans are fabulous.  YOU MUST FOLLOW SEASONING DIRECTIONS THAT COME WITH THE PAN!  Be patient!  This pan will last forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE: I now have the 14\" skillet.  Again, I followed the instructions that came with the pan for removing the beeswax.  I boiled a huge pan of water, placed the skillet in the bathtub and poured the water over the skillet.  I wiped the pan with paper towels  to remove residue....did that twice.  I then washed the pan with a plastic brush and hot water -NO SOAP!  I put  grapeseed oil in the skillet and heated for 5 minutes, let it cool...do this twice. My skillet is now nonstick.  I will use it everyday for a few days to continue the seasoning process. Like a lot of people I was looking to the Clad bran for a 14\" skillet but that skillet was over $100.00.  I feel like I have gotten a better pan for less money.  I wish I had known about these pans before I spent hundreds on Clad pans.\n",
      "This is a fantastic piece of cookware if you season it correctly. Mine turned out perfectly non-stick and will now be my \"go to\" pan for many dishes in the kitchen.  Would suggest taking your time seasoning and following these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Preheat the new pan in the oven @ 200 for about 30 min on a baking tray lined with partchment paper.  This will soften the wax coating on the pan.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Under very hot water, wash the pan in soap and scrub with a brush or hard sponge to remove the beeswax. Suggest feeling with your fingers for smoothness inside and out. This will be a sign that you removed all the beeswax.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Back in the over @ 200 degrees for about 10 min or until dry.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Remove from oven and boost the temp to 500. Coat with Flax Seed Oil (Lightly) and put in the over upside down for about an hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Let the pan cool fully then repeat steps  3 & 4 about 3 or 4 total times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key is to have a LIGHT coverage of oil each time so it bonds to the pan. Too much and you will have challenges getting this seasoned correctly.\n",
      "I would never buy these pans again. It was coated with beeswax and was a terrible messy job to remove. Also, the inner edge of the pan is sharp unlike like my Debeyer steel pan.\n",
      "Quite surprised that it rusted.  You evidently need to season and heat dry like you would cast iron.\n",
      "The 9.5 inch pan has a cooking surface of 8 inches.  Which I find is a large as necessary as I don't generally serve meals on giant bistro sized plates in my home, and I imagine, neither do you.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wax coating...I'm not sure what bonehead thought to try and remove this with soap and water as this is just foolish...and there seems to be a lot of negative reviews from many such fools.  It's WAX people...it MELTS!!!!  Just heat up the pan for 30 seconds on the stove and wipe the wax off!!!  easy!!!  DUH!  Do this a few times until you are satisfied the wax is gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "My only complaints are that the handle pitch is steeper than I like, not a deal breaker.  And when I went to oven season this pan at 400*f for two hours, the paint/ coating on the handle, came off on my oven mitt after about 1/2 hour.  I left the pan for the 2hr duration and this seemed to harden the coating and it's no longer a problem.  So if you plan to use this pan in a hot oven, season it in a hot oven, not by some other means.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, on to seasoning.  I don't fall in for all the wives tales of salt and potato skins etc...what a waste!  Just melt in the pan some oil -  ANY KIND OF COOKING OIL -  be it lard, beef tallow, canola,...anything!  Numerous test have shown that there is not \"noticeable or significant\" difference in performance between oils.  There are minute chemical properties that may make one type of oil superior in durablitiy than another,  but like I said \"  there is not \"noticeable or significant\" difference ...\"  Now, heat on the stove till it just starts to smoke, wipe out the excess oil and let the pan cool.  Do this 4-5 times in 20 minutes and your set!\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want a more durable seasoning, bake the last seasoning at 400*f for two hours and let COOL IN THE OVEN naturally.  With this Mauviel pan, this oven baking seems a necessity or the coating on the handle will be unstable until you do.  For what it's worth, I found the coating on the Paderno World Cuisine pans do not have this problem.  Now, saute some onions, celery, peppers or other veggie in the pan first.  NOT EGGS OR FISH OR CREPES!!!  After the veggie, You will have a plenty slippery pant good for whatever strikes your fancy\n",

      "\n",
      "This pan needs to be seasoned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please refer to my PICTURES for the steps (they are out of order but you get the idea):\n",
      "1. heat the pan\n",
      "2. pour in A LOT of salt\n",
      "3. pour in lots of vegetable oil\n",
      "4. add potato peels\n",
      "5. use a wood spatula to mix it around until the vegetable peels are burnt to a crisp\n",
      "6. the pan will change color (it will take on a patina layer and color)\n",
      "\n",
      "I suggest you only use a wood or silicone spatula...if any food gets stuck on it, gently push it off with the wood spatula.\n",
      "\n",
      "Never scrub this pan with an abrasive material; typically all it needs it some oil and a paper towel cleaning.\n",
      "Don't buy it unless you  have an extra half hour or more to get the wax off.\n",
      "Beautiful crepe pan arrived waxed as advertised. The wax was so  thick the recommended wash in\n",
      "hot water was a  joke. First of all do want wax  liquid down your drain, only for it to solidify somewhat\n",
      "on  its travels. What I did was to scrap off  as much wax  as possible with a piece  soft plastic. Both  sides are waxed.\n",
      "Then I boiled the kettle  of water and rinsed the pan several times over the toilet  and whiping off  the dirty industrial\n",
      "wax. Rinsed and rinsed only then I was able to oil it  to season the metal.\n",
      "It is the perfect french pan.\n",
      "This pan is pretty awesome especially for the price (>$75), but... The wax coating, super irritating to remove. I'd understand the coating on copper or carbon steel but stainless? The pan discolored quickly after/during use. I used a infrared thermometer the pan never hit above 350(low-med heat on my stove) but still discolored as if I had superheated it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those were the cons... Pros are:\n",
      "Super even heat, I checked the middle, and the edges on a grid with the thermometer, all readings were within 25 degrees which is quite a feat on a gas range.\n",
      "I just purchased the 12.5in pan. I started with heating the pan on the gas stovetop to wipe the beeswax off, then proceded to use a clean cotton towel to apply very thin layers of organic flaxseed oil. I placed the pan in the oven at 500F for about 1.5 hours. Every 10-15mins I would apply another thin layer of flaxseed oil to the entire pan inside and outside. Once the 1.5 hours were up, I turned the oven off and let the pan cool to the touch. The pan turned a dark smooth brown. I used it that same day for searing a few steaks off and then the next morning for eggs. The flaxseed coating made the pan nonstick and everything was cooked evenly and slid out of the pan with ease. Clean up was easy with hot water and a sponge. Note: on items like proteins with fat that melts in the pan and becomes gummy, just allow the pan to cool, then wash with hot water and a sponge, all came off the pan with ease and was ready for the next product to be cooked. Love his pan and hope this helps.\n",
      "I'm in love with this pan. I should've purchase the larger pan. Great for searing.\n",
      "Absolutely wonderful, just what I wanted, cooked in it once and is almost non stick at this point, couldn't have expected more if I had wanted.\n",
      "A real bargain for the money.\n",
      "I really really want to like it...after all the reviews online and Cooks...but it is a problem to season.  I have been using same cast iron skillets since 1950's, and burned them off and reseasoned several times...But this is a different animal.  Maybe I will like it...\n",
      "We will see.  It burned uneven when I used flaxseed oil to season...smoked the house up... the jury is still out.\n",
      "BEST for the money.\n",
      "This is one of my favorite pans, and I have nice cuprinox extra thicks to compare it to. The bees wax took me literally a minute to wipe off after putting in on the stove and heating the pan up. Seasoning was also easy and now my pan has a mirror finish. My baba would be proud of my palachinke!\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I'll note that I was worried that the 9.5\" was going to be too small of a pan. However I found it forces me to make crepes that perfectly fit a standard dinner plate.\n",
      "I seasoned this per the instructions and it's performing exceptionally well.  I highly recommend this product.\n",
      "great pan, like the way it feel in my hand. waiting for the frying put it on sale.\n",
      "Yeah, as others have noted, this was not particularly fun to season. If you screw it up, like I did, boiling some vinegar in the pan will greatly hasten removing the bad seasoning.  I found that it was much easier to season the 9.5\" pan than the 8\". I have no idea why, but the way the 9.5\" inch pan heated more slowly and evenly on my electric stove may have had something to do with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once I got it seasoned, I fell in love with it. It's just a super nice pan. Crepes cooked very evenly on it. None stuck. Maintained temp pretty well on my really weird, terrible stove (which has since gone to where horrible stoves go when they die). Have not used it on my new stove yet, but I expect even better results with more consistent temps from the stove.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am a huge fan of cast iron cookware, and this is a fairly natural extension of that concept, only lighter. If you like/love cast iron, you will really enjoy this pan. I bought this to use exclusively for crepes, at the time, but can see myself using it for other things as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "I see more such pans in my future, and I would definitely recommend this one. Love that it works on induction as well. Inexpensive. Quality. What more could you want?\n",
      "Excellent product.  I recommend it.  Good quality steel and well balanced.  This will last many years.  I use this to make one egg omelettes.  One scrambled egg will coat the bottom of the pan nicely.  I placed it in boiling water to remove the protective wax coating.  Then, I poured boiling water over it outdoors.  Anyone complaining about not being able to remove the wax did not put a decent effort into it.\n",
      "I'm giving this pan 5 stars even though I didn't do a perfect job seasoning it.  I read the reviews that described various seasoning methods.  I used the technique of heating an oven to 500F.  My seasoning was uneven, meaning I didn't do it right.  I don't know exactly what I did wrong, but I think it was a combination of factors.  I am continuing to build up the seasoning by using a very hot burner (gas) and it is evening out - but I don't think it will be totally even.  I'm toying with buying a de Buyer pan and trying to get a perfect seasoning.  (I used flax oil, which I find works very well.)  I did find that using boiling water to clean off the beeswax worked perfectly - don't bother with hot tap water!\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, the pan WORKS well. Both crpes and omelettes slide around and come loose easily.  The pan is of solid construction and I'm sure it will last a lifetime unless there is a nuclear holocaust.\n",
      "\n",
      "My biggest takeaway is that I know am in love with blue steel cookware!  I'm looking at other steel pieces to add my kitchen, plus I've taken to seasoning a stainless steel saut pan that I also use for omelettes, sauting ingredient and other tasks.  One of the advantages to steel is the weight - I can take pieces on camping trips, whereas cast iron is too heavy.\n",
      "\n",
      "My basic crpe produces great crpes now, but my rolling technique for fillings?  Ah, I can use some practice.\n",
      "great cooking surface, easy to clean up.\n",
      "Ordered as a gift to my son. Came quickly, exactly as ordered. He has used it for several weeks and reports he loves it. He said that the pan is developing a nice cooking surface that is becoming more non-stick with each use.\n",
      "We've tried many teflon pans and within a year they start to flake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being a cast iron skillet fan, I wanted to try this frying pan. its been about a month and I love this pan. Seasoning was easy! Ever since then, using this pan has been a breeze. Eggs, potatoes, with a little oil or butter this pan sears and cooks great.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommend you try one of these. Keep it cleaned with a stainless steel pad (no soap), put a dab of oil in there and it ready for the next meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update: 6 months later. This is still my go to pan. The only times I've had to reseason was when the cleaning people washed is with dish soap. One cleaning recommendation: use course kosher salt and a scrub brush to clean after using, then apply a small amount of olive oil and you're ready for the next use. This pan should last a very long time,\n",
      "I tried for three days to remove the beeswax applied to this pan so it wouldn't rust in the package and nothing worked.  They say use very hot water.  How do you get that much hot water and what would you even put it in to soak this?  Even the dishwasher didn't help.  What a mess.\n",

      "This is a rare fail for Mauviel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Life is just too short to deal with this kind of stupidity, especially when the exact same style of pan (right down to the handle that Mauviel copied) from de Buyer does not have this issue at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a full set of Mauviel copper and have no complaints with it, but this is just going in the garbage.  It's incredible how stupid this is.\n",
      "Perfect, perfect, perfect\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing is better than perfect.\n",
      "I have seasoned over and over but it still sticks. Hopefully with time it will become non stick. I do like the pan.\n",
      "Much lighter than cast iron and just as good for my purposes.\n",
      "A big fab of Mauviel cookware, but couldn't afford more than a roasting pan until I saw these crepe pan on Amazon, such an excellent pan for crepes that I'm ordering my second pan in a 9.5\" size.  Before I used the pan for the first time I boiled some water in a kettle and poured hot water in, let it soak for a couple of minutes to remove the waxy coating that is customary for European or old cooking ware.  I lined the sink drain with a couple of paper towels to collect all the wax, and in no more than 5 minutes the pan was ready for use, just by wiping it off with another paper towel. My first try was using a recipe for English pancakes from BBC site and it was a throw back to childhood pancakes served just with a bit of lemon rind and butter. I'm not a culinary  master, so this is a pretty foolproof pan and the ingredients for crepes don't run more than a few dollars. Recommend buying a handle heat sleeve, found it less cumbersome than using a kitchen towel.\n",
      "Purchased this pan mainly to make crepes.  I seasoned the pan using the \"oil, heat, wipe\" method doing this 7 times.  The results were great, giving a beautiful black, smooth, uniform non stick finish.  Everything was fine until I attempted to use the pan on our gas kitchen stove.  The pan exhibits a serious tendency to heat unevenly giving with very pronounced hot spots requiring constant movements of the pan  to promote even heating.  Without this moving the result is extremely uneven cooking of the crepes.  On an electric stove the results are fine because of the design of the heating elements.  Probably on an induction cooktop, or outdoor grill the results would be the same as on an electric stove.  I really like the pan, the only complaint being uneven heating on gas cooktops.  If your use will be mainly on a gas stove give serious thought to your selection of this type pan, cast iron may be better.\n",
      "my husband uses this exclusively and loves it\n",
      "great pan.  I have an induction cook top, works great.\n",
      "Struggling to remove the wax and get it properly seasoned.  Feels as heavy as my cast iron pans, thought this would be a lighter weight alternative.\n",
      "only thing is how to properly season this pan.  Do your research.  Not sure if I did it properly.  Heats up quickly but it gets hotter near the center where the flame is.  Works good on gas range.\n",
      "Read the following instructions on cleaning off the beeswax finish. If you do so, you will love this pan. If you do not, and try to clean off the wax by washing it in the sink, you will hate this pan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pan comes with a protective beeswax finish that must be removed before the pan is seasoned, and used. It literally takes 30 seconds to do it properly, or 10 hours if you do it wrong. Simply heat a kettle of water to boiling, and pour it over the pan. Wipe out any residue and repeat, if necessary. Voila. Beeswax gone. If you are concerned about the beeswax going down your sink, then do this outside, away from any landscaping you care about, that would be harmed by the hot water.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you try to clean off the wax in the sink with soapy water, you will still be doing it 8 days from now. Don't reinvent the wheel. Only heat will melt wax, whether it's beeswax or any other kind of wax.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next step, seasoning the pan. The instructions are here on the Mauviel website: http://www.mauvielusa.com/M-steel-Crepes-Pan-Steel-Handle-8--plu3653.20.html. In a nutshell, cover the bottom of the pan with oil that does not have a strong flavor, heat for 5 minutes over medium heat. Turn off the heat, move off the burner, and let the pan cool. Pour off the oil, wipe clean with paper towels, and repeat the process a 2nd time. The pan is now seasoned and ready to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that, treat this carbon steel pan as you would cast iron. Do NOT clean it with soap and water, and do NOT heat shock the pan. Rinse it off with hot water after use, scrubbing it with a brush or dishrag as needed, with NO SOAP, dry thoroughly right away, and the pan will perform beautifully. It will develop a non toxic non stick finish without any chemicals.\n",
      "\n",
      "I read another review that this small pan would not sit correctly on the counter or stove because the handle is too long. That has not been my experience. My pan is perfectly balanced, and will sit flat and not tip over, even empty.\n",
      "\n",
      "This sized pan is absolutely perfect for making individual omelettes. They finish rapidly, so you can crank out omelettes for everyone on a weekend morning. Enjoy!\n",
      "\n",
      "Update:\n",
      "I've now used this pan to make omelettes about 10 times. Mauve crepe pan, where have you been all my life. This is better nonstick than any of the chemical nonstick pans I've ever used, and all without the chemicals. It's absurdly easy to keep clean (it just wipes clean with the merest spray of water.) I never could get an omelette to turn out right, and now I'm turning out perfect French and American style omelettes. (The difference is the French omelette is stirred and shaken continuously for a curd consistency with no browning, while the American version is more browned.)\n",
      "Nothing sticks to this pan, what a great pan for crepes and even pancakes.\n",
      "I got it to sear steaks and other meats and finish cooking in the oven. Works great.\n",
      "These required a bit of \"rework\" in my cooking habits... Mainly I had to use lower heat and always ensure I used oil/butter... But once seasoned, they are a work horse!\n",
      "I had trouble trying to figure out how to correctly season the pan. I first used flax oil as suggested in a you tube video .\n",
      "The pan just did not work well finally after scrubbing it clean I seasoned it using Crisco Vegetable Shortening and it turned out\n",
      "beautiful. I use it several times a week and it works well. I occasional will throw some Crisco in it and season another layer.\n",
      "See my original review below, I have updated to 5 stars.  While it was still a giant pain removing the beeswax, this has become my most used pan (and I have many).  In light of that I had to award another star.\n",
      "\n",
      "Original review:\n",
      "I would give it 5 stars except it was such a chore removing the beeswax.  I love the weight and feel of the pan and the even heat distribution, so it was worth the work.  Once you have it seasoned it is easy to clean and my go-to pan for small cooking jobs.  The 9 1/2 inch is the perfect size for anything from burgers and grilled cheese to omelets.\n",
      "I read the Cooks review of carbon steel pans and I read many great reviews on Amazon for this Mauviel pan. Construction is top-notch. I have been using this for over 6 months several times a week. I wash it in such a way as to preserve as much patina as possible. But this pan is great at is browning, the best I have and I have a bit of everything. But \"non-stick\"? Nope. Things stick - that's why it browns well. What remains stuck in the pan actually releases easily, so it's the perfect pan for a dish with anything fried or sauteed and then deglazing the pan into a sauce. But fried eggs sliding off? Hahahaha\n",
      "\n",
      "Update after almost a year: this is my go-to pan for any kind of saute, fry, browning, etc. The patina across most of the bottom is a very dark brown. Yes things stick - it's gradually better, and no I would still not fry eggs in this and hope to get them off with the yolk not breaking. If you want true non-stick, go get Teflon, though I hate the short lifetime and waste of these. This Mauviel though, this is a lifetime tool, I love it. 5 stars.\n",
      "This is my second mauviel steel pan. With a good seasoning, these are non stick and extremely durable. The 12\" is gigantic, the 8 inch is small (2-3 eggs), the 11 inch may be best for a small family.\n",
      "Not as good as the Matfer, was very hard to get off wax and pan burns easily.  Had to lower gas.\n",
      "Seasoning the skillet was not easy. I tried Mauviel's recommendation; it was not good. Fried eggs stuck to the pan. I tried using the technique I've used to season my woks, and I still got the same result when frying an egg. I got online with Cook's Illustrated and followed their recommended technique: salt, oil, and potato peels. Much better result (the skillet surface is now a deep black) though still not perfect. Not having used a carbon steel skillet before, I'm sure there is a learning curve involved. I'm still on the uphill side of the curve after using the skillet for about three weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update after 7 months of use: Can't recommend it. Seasoning is a BIG problem. After finally(!) ending up with a properly seasoned deep black surface, the frying pan's surface continues to be a problem. Scrambled eggs, bacon, and other easy-to-cook foods attack the seasoned surface. Parts of the seasoning break loose during the cooking so that after careful cleaning of the frying pan (no soap, no harsh scrubbing materials -- I've simply used paper towels) bright, shiny surfaces show up while other parts of the seasoned surface remain intact. My conclusion is -- and I'm not a metallurgist, is that the steel's metallurgic content is inconsistent throughout the surface. Thus, some seasoned parts are perfect while others are suddenly unseasoned. A very frustrating experience.\n",
      "I've only used it once so far, but the first impression is great. I seasoned it with cooking oil twice per the instructions. I then fried meat in a little bit of oil, with absolutely no sticking--even in the first few minutes before the meat seared. It cleaned up very nicely, too. I have long experience with conventional cast iron skillets. I wonder if this pan works so nicely because the steel cooking surface is more finely machined than is the case for cast iron pans. I will still use cast iron for high temperatures and when the pan needs to go into the oven, but I fully intend to use this pan extensively. (And, I just ordered a second one in a smaller size--the 12.5 in is quite large and heavy).\n",
      "I originally thought this pan while not non stick would come around after repeated seasonings just like my many cast iron pans. After a year of use, I am very disappointed. I have seasoned and re-seasoned this pan using every different method possible. I can not use this pan for eggs without knowing I will be scrubbing for a while to get it clean. Does not matter how much fat I put in the pan. Very disappointed.\n",
      "Finally a non-stick pan for my eggs!  I followed the directions to get the wax off and season it and haven't had anything stick since. Yay!\n",
      "I love this pan! Works great for cooking a small meat along with vegetables. I think I need another bigger one, too!\n",
      "This is the perfect pan for your kitchen. I'm really happy with my purchase and think to buy more in different sizes!\n",
      "I've only maded a few dinners using this, so I'm still creating a better non-stick surface. Heats evenly. Sears very nicely. The pan comes sealed in beeswax to prevent corrosion. Not easy to remove. I placed the pan inverted on a cookie sheet in the oven at a low temperture and let the wax melt. Wiped the pan with a paper towel. Pan is well contructed, although I find the handle difficult to grab, as the edges are square and don't fit a hand well. I've been using a towel, but think I will get a silicone handle overlay to overcome this issue.\n",
      "Arrived on time, in perfect condition.  I cleaned the wax off and seasoned per instructions (and comments on this site). Does an awesome job of searing meats and developing fond, which was the reason I bought it.  Love this pan!\n",
      "Take care of your pan and it will take care of you.\n",
      "While I love my cast iron pans, the large ones are getting too heavy for me. I bought this pan to try out the M'Steel line and am so far pleased with it. The key to success is proper seasoning. You cannot use it out of the box, even just seasoning once. Look up the right way to season and you'll find that the proper oil (flaxseed) and proper method (by oven using several seasoning sessions) will yield a natural non-stick finish that will last for years if properly maintained. Yes, this pan has a beeswax protective finish - just use very hot water and a non- stick pad to get the wax off. Then I heated the pan and wiped off any residue.\n",
      "Pro: I purchased this pan about 30 years ago.  It gets constant use (e.g.: crepes, omelettes, eggs, etc.) and still functions flawlessly,  It certainly looks and performs no worse for the wear.  I don't use soap on it, just water and a scrubbie, if needed, and dry immediately.  It now has a lovely, natural non-stick quality (that won't give you cancer, either).  My younger relatives will probably inherit this pan as I imagine it will last another 30 years, too.  Definitely a recommended purchase.\n",

      "This is super quality steel cookware. It's heavy enough to use on our electric flat-top stove. The protective beeswax is tough to remove, but just use nearly boiling water instead of hot water. Immediate melt and rinse. I was kkkenchef in Tivoli Gardens in the 80's; we had bigger pans to use, but nowhere near as nice as these. I bought an 8\" pan as well. Tops. Morgan Phenix\n",
      "Just got an induction cooktop and needed a fry pan to fit.  This is the perfect size for one person meals, or for two light eaters.  Easy to season and clean, and I do believe my eggs taste better.\n",
      "To start, 11-inch is equal to 28cm.  It is the perfect size for the large burner on most cooktops.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pan was lighter than I thought it would be, much lighter than the de Buyer carbon steel or \"mineral\" fry pans I owned before.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the layer of beeswax, don't let it intimidate you.  The coating is really thin, so I put it the pan in a 200 degree oven and wiped the melted wax off with paper towel before seasoning. Be sure to put some towels on the counter too, since the bottom of the pan is also coated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"seasoning\" was simple.  Add some canola oil, heat, wipe and repeat.  It gets any residual beeswax off as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the first day, I made hash browns from scratch (added butter and olive oil to the pan) and the results were just as good compared to my \"seasoned\" 20-year old de Buyer carbon steel pan.  Fried up a burger patty and there were no issues with sticking.  I think my newer de Buyer \"mineral\" frypan would have had problems rising to this challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many home cooks are afraid of sticking.  The trick is to trust in the Maillard reaction: heat up the pan, put in the food, and let it cook for a bit rather than fiddling with it, then complaining everything \"sticks\".\n",

      "This Mauviel 14 inch fry pan is large. So far I've saut&eacute;ed vegetables in it and used in the oven to broil some salmon. In both these tasks it did well. The vegetables stayed crispy and cooked evenly. In the broiler it held a longer filet easily. However with its long handle it protruded outside the oven door no big deal fish cooked perfectly the oven takes credit here.\n",
      "I'm planning on a paella later on this summer. Very similar to the couple other carbon steel pans I own from another French company. These pans\n",
      "Sear like no other.\n",
      "I purchased the 12.5\" version of this pan from Amazon and I am completely satisfied. Easy to clean off beeswax (water from kettle and paper towels)and easy to season (as described from Mauviel).  Since then the pan is amazingly non-stick and a joy to use. This pan is a great find, a great buy and will last a lifetime!\n",
      "I bought the Mauviel M'steel Frying Pan in the 8 inch and 9.5 inch this Christmas to replace some Calphalon Non Stick pans that were wearing out.  Real Simple magazine had a review on this brand and indicated they were a great buy/great find.\n",
      "\n",
      "They arrived very well packed, and had a layer of wax on them to protect them as well.  It was a bit daunting to get the wax off, and took a bit of time to cure them--we did the process (peanut oil and high heat) two times, and then were very careful when cooking with them for a few times after.\n",
      "\n",
      "The effort was well worth it!  The pans are the perfect sizes for just an egg (8 inch) or eggs or an omelette or potatoes (9.5 inch) and they are completely non stick now.  The handle feels substantial and very comfortable (I have small hands, my honey has big hands and we both like the handle equally).  My honey says that eggs taste better in these pans than any pan he has cooked with in many years--and he is a wonderful cook with lots of experience!\n",
      "\n",
      "We do not use soap, and we wash out the pans by hand, dry them and hang from our pot rack in the kitchen which protects them from bumping into other pots and pans.\n",

      "We have used the pans almost every day since Christmas--10 to 12 times each at least.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really like the way they look too.  Very utilitarian looking, they make a statement about how serious we are about cooking and preparing tasty meals.

      "UPDATE:  It has now been several months and if it is possible to be even happier with these pans, well we are!  Food just slides off them, nothing ever sticks, it's a breeze to cook anything and everything tastes better cooked in them--I don't understand how that can be, but it is!  We cooked a cheese quesadilla recently with a little olive oil--wow--it browned up each side of the tortilla beautifully--melted the cheese perfectly--so the food was visually attractive and tasted great!  We occasionally add more oil to the bottom of it, turn on the burner briefly, and then wipe it out.  The pans have developed a beautiful patina--handles are still sturdy and I expect these pans to last a good long time.\n",
      "Perfect. We bought this to use as a coffee serving tray because we wanted something simple for everyday use, it fills the bill perfectly. Sturdy but not too heavy. Nice finish.\n",
      "This is the second oil sprayer I've owned.  I forget what happened to the first ... at any rate, this one works like the other one did.  It sprays fairly well, but not for very long.  You pump it several times, spray for a bit, then pump it more, spray some more, repeat ... it's annoying to have to repeat it so often, but if you want just a little olive oil on something, it works. I've never had any issues with it getting jammed or plugged up.  That was a concern I had when I read other reviews for various oil sprayers.  Maybe the kind of oil you use matters?  I use extra virgin olive oil.\n",
      "It looks pretty sturdy, so I thought I was getting a bargain compared to the Misto. That is until a few weeks went by and I noticed that the bottle was sort of listing to the side. I looked closer and realized that the rubber base was starting to press out from the metal canister. It's a pretty big design flaw, considering that the pressure that causes a nice fine mist causes the product to fall apart. I'm off to buy the Misto.\n",
      "it works just fine provided you don't fill it more than 1/3 and don't pump it more than 10 times.\n",
      "when the spray slows open the lid to let the remaining pressure out and pump it and use it again a bit of a pain but way better than using pam make sure to let the pressure out when done so you don't blow a seal\n",
      "I would not re order this product it is made very very cheap. I went out and bought a better one\n",
      "I love love love love this Oil Sprayer. Only had it a day, so I have no idea how long it will last, but it def does what it was intended to do.\n",
      "I now have the Misto and the Trudeau sprayers and feel that they both perform very well.  They both spray a heavy mist.  I use mine for mixing essential oils with water to spray on items before i iron them.  I love using lavender oil because it smells so fresh.  But also spearmint oil is great for the kitchen.  I put 1/2 cup water in the sprayer and add 5 drops of oil.  The stainless steel canister is nice to look at and pretty heavy duty.\n",
      "good quality and works well, survived my cousins playing with it a few times and it gets the job done without breaking your bank\n",
      "We recently went all stainless in our appliances so I thought this mister would be good for my kitchen.  I had tried a different brand as well and although the other one works, it is plastic!  This one is stainless and has a nice feel.  The only down side is that you can't see through the stainless to know how low your oil level is.  But, it will last a long time.  I have found that I do NOT depressurize the mister and like the results better.  Very  nice find and I am not getting all the chemicals from the aersols.\n",
      "We loved this pump for the first several months after buying it. And then it started to leak oil onto my hand when I'd go to use it. I'm not sure if it's something we did wrong, but it ended up being useless - no more spray, just leaking.\n",
      "There is some leakage after using the Trudeau Oil Spray Pump.  So just wipe the exterior with\n",
      "a paper towel.  Since it seems I have to do this type of wiping with several products, I don't find this to be\n",
      "an issue.  Also, have found that it is important to release the pressure after use before storing.\n",
      "Seems to give a better spray for the next time after the normal pumping process.\n",
      "Bought thinking it would keep the pressure consistent. It's hit or miss. It ends up streaming oil rather than a mist.\n",
      "But after about 9 months, will only put out a lazer-like stream of oil.  I've tried all different fill and pressure levels, nothing makes any difference. This purchase was money wasted.\n",
      "I had this sprayer in my saved items for a very long time.  I liked the idea of misting oil onto my greens but had a hard time justifying the cost when I can just pour oil from the bottle or can.\n",
      "\n",
      "I finally bought it.  It works as it should.  The only con and reason for 4 stars rather than five is that, no matter how much you pump air into it, you only get about 2-3 seconds of actual mist.  I realize the point of my purchase was to reduce the amount of olive oil I sprayed on my salads but I do end up having to pump it up and mist twice.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the plus side - the bottle is stainless steel.  Many people don't know this but olive oil should not be subjected to light and should also be refrigerated.  I keep my Trudeau Oil Spray Pump in the refrigerator and haven't had any problems with the mister clogging, and the stainless steel finish keeps the oil protected from light.  The quality is pretty good - much better than a plastic one I've had for years.\n",
      "\n",
      "5/26/12 UPDATE:\n",
      "I've been using this sprayer about once per day for over a week now and the spraying nozzle no longer works.  I pumped air into the thing but now no longer get a mist but a slight drizzle that runs down the side of the bottle.  Also, I never bothered to look until I was asked by a reader of my initial review, but the bottle and spraying mechanism is all plastic, only covered by a stainless steel shell.  To the manufacturer's credit the design keeps light away from you olive oil (if that's what you keep inside), but other than that, this is just an expensive version of every other cheap sprayer out there.  I realize some sprayers keep working better than others, but I still say, \"Learn from my false optimism and look for another.\"\n",
      "I like using my favorite olive oil so this fits in well.  I don't like filling the landfills with empty cans from PAM etc products similar so this makes me happy.  Reuseable... refillable...  and I get to use the oil I want..  I spray a pan, a salad or my hands when working with dough.  Glad to buy olive oil on sale, saves even more money..  By reuse this Trudeau paid for itself.  Very reliable.  Looks good on the shelf.  Good gift idea, the gift that keeps giving...\n",
      "This is the first oil mister I bought. I liked it well enough at first, but it got so it wouldn't spray reliably. It also isn't the prettiest gadget to look at, which is more important than you might think when it's living on your kitchen counter. To replace it after it went kaput entirely, I bought this product instead:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Prepara-Oil-Mister-White/dp/B0026L7BNU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Prepara Oil Mister, White</a>. It's attractive and so far has had a much more reliable spray.\n",
      "The elusive \"perfect mist bottle\" for oil is still out there somewhere, but this unit comes close.  Easy to use, sprays well, and looks nice on a countertop.  Not quite a 5-star unit, but definitely a solid 4, and its still a purchase that I am glad I made.  Shipping was very fast with Amazon Prime.\n",
      "I ordered this sprayer to replace the aerosol one and I put canola oil into it and really think it works well.  Almost every time you use it you have to \"pump\" it up but it's worth it.  You can use your choice of oil in it and I think it holds about 3/4 cup or so and that lasts a long while.  So far, I haven't had to refill it.  I would recommend it because the quality seems good and it looks nice on the countertop too!\n",
      "Is fantastic for olive oil.. OO is very expensive so it good to use a product like this so ur sure to get the best use out of ur OO.. Works perfect no issues what so ever.. Remember to only fill it about half way because it does need room inside for the air u pump in.. And make sure to use all the air inside before opening it or if there is oil and air inside and u open well u might just feel like ur in some kind of adult party..\n",

      "Hmmm. I was on the fence about whether this should get 3 or 4 stars. I'm feeling charitable today, so it's getting 4.  The tray is nice looking, but way thinner than expected. Also, I had to put felt underneath it so it wouldn't scratch my counter. That said, it'll do. The better quality trays were twice as expensive. You get what you pay for here.\n",

The only reason I gave four stars is because tray came with very small dents that were only noticeable when the light was shining in the right place.

      "This is simply a great wok. It's very well built, it's packaged very safely with a protective laquer over the metal, and the handle separates from the pan for convenient storage. It even cooks vegetables when placed over a heating source, but that's just a bonus.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not recommend this product for use in home defense though, for that I'd recommend a standard frying pan. However, with just that own caveat, I don't see any reason why this isn't a five star product.\n",
      "This wok is a nice size and we are very pleased with it.  It is pretty. I know that may not be a big determining factor to mention on a wok but its nice to like looking at what you are cooking in.  Its overall good quality.  Recommend.\n",
      "I bought this wok because my non-stick wok started flaking and I didn't want to season a carbon steel wok. After reading so many reviews about apartments filling with smoke due to seasoning a wok, I wanted something that I can start cooking with easily. The wok was nicely packaged when delivered and came with instructions on how to prepare it for its first time use. First, you have to cook off the food-safe clear lacquer coating by heating oil on it and rubbing the wok with paper towels (sounds A LOT like seasoning a wok...). The lacquer was kind of hard to get off in some places and I tried heating oil and rubbing four or more times. There still seemed to be a little lacquer left on the sides of the bottom no matter how hard i scrubbed (but you can't scrub it with anything hard because you'll \"rub off the seasoned coating\"). So I gave up and just decided to cook with whatever of the lacquer was remaining because I was tired of heating oil and the lacquer's supposed to be food-safe. Other than that, the wok seems to be fine now. Steaming and boiling foods is not recommended in the wok because it will \"ruin\" the pre-seasoned coating. You also cannot wash it with soap or it will \"ruin\" the coating, so you should rinse it under hot water, rub it with a soft sponge or something, dry it by heating it on the stove, and coat it with a little oil before storing it away. It's a bit high maintenance compared to a non-stick wok, but at least you don't have to replace it as often (unless it starts to rust because you ruined the coating.)\n",
      "Great tray for the price. Shiny without looking gaudy. Fits the bottle and probably 6 glasses (pic attached with 4). A good complement to the gift I gave my husband of a crystal decanter and glasses.\n",
      "Love these trays.\n",
      "Clean, sleek and elegant looking.\n",
      "So far I haven't used them much but they do have some minor scratching here and there.\n",

      "Absolutely beautiful!\n",
      "Excellent tray. I use it every day as I'm disabled, and need to transport my food on a tray. I bought one a few years ago, eventually a few rust spots, so replaced it with the identical one. Not too heavy, nice shine, great tray!\n",

      "Looks great. Smooth, nice curved edges, and shiny.\n",
      "Met all my expectations 1. Got here on time, and 2. Good quality for the price, and 3. It's beautiful.\n",
      "This tray works great on our newly installed bartop. The surface is nearly a mirror finish and is large enough to hold two 4 in x 4 in decanters plus a small bartender guidebook. It really pulls everything together and gives a nice look to the bar.\n",
      "I received this as a present.  The shape and such of it are nice.  But the lacquer used to preserve the wok is terrible.  You have to clean it off by wiping it down with a tablespoon of oil and heating it to medium high heat.  The bottom of the wok quickly browned and was releasing an acrid smoke.  Then you wipe it down with a clean paper towel.  You have to do this twice to get it off.  So then I did it again to be sure it is all gone.  Same awful smell and more discoloration.  This is necessary because it takes REALLY hot oil to get this off because nearest to the base of the wok there is a clear line of where the lacquer was taken off and where you can not get it off from because the oil is not hot enough and the paper towels used to rub this down stick to the line.  I tried it a third time, no smoke and the lacquer line went higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "They should have used a food safe food wax similar to what cast iron skillets use.  It's so much easier to take off because you can use hot soapy water for that first use then just season the inside and out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would not recommend anyone getting this because of it.  I'm afraid to use this wok because of the lacquer that won't come off.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point I've tried hot oil 5 times.  Using more oil seems to help but still unless you get the oil to the top it won't come off.  I've also tried a few things I read online: hot soap and water, boil a mix of 1 T baking soda to 1 qt water for 15 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Look for a wok that has oil used to preserve it.  It may seem weird but apparently that's why lacquer is used is because people freak out over the oil but both are just to preserve and make the wok look nice on the shelf.  But many good woks just use oil.\n",
      "I've always heard that a nice heavy wok is the way to go and this is a good one for you but because its Carbon steel it rusts so fast. i have finished washing it and i dried it apparently not to well because next time i went in the cabinet to grab the wok there was rust stains on the outside bottom and inside bottom. i washed it out really well dried it with a dry paper towel and made sure it was dry this time. the removable handle is great for space and cleaning. but over all great product\n",

      "I received this item with a damaged corner but kept it anyway. Now I wish I wouldn't have. The shiny metallic finish comes off very easy. Sitting any items on the tray can cause it to scratch and then it just looks awful.

      "This tray is awesome.  It was purchased as a tray for a decanter set I bought (I just needed a silver tray, really).  So glad I went with Godinger!  The tray is gorgeous, and so shiny it's essentially a mirror.  It also has a great weight to it, I definitely don't feel like it would bend without extreme force.  Awesome tray.\n",

      "Update - So, I finally put the decanter and glasses on this tray, and within SECONDS it was covered in scratches.  Not deep ones, but noticeably scuffed up scratch marks.  Super disappointed.\n",

      "Not really a mirror, but very nice.\n",
      "Beautiful! My perfumes look very nice on this silver plated plate.\n",
      "Love the honey pot. The only issue is that the lid is hard to get off sometimes. Maybe it's just sticky from honey (but we keep it very clean) or maybe it's the suction on the lid. Either way, that's the only issue. Otherwise, it's a very good-looking, very great-functioning honey pot. Much nicer and sanitary than the wood versions that we contemplated IMO. Holds 1 cup of honey.\n",
      "My wife is happy with it so far; it's not fancy but it's a presentable tray at a reasonable price.\n",
      "I recommnd this beautiful tray.\n",

      "This is a beautiful tray, and the price makes it even better.  I purchased it to sit on my bar, and it looks great with liquor bottles sitting on it.  Just keep in mind that it is not a large tray.\n",
      "Very attractive, scratches easily but to be expected on such a shiny tray.  Bought 4 of these, I wish they came in larger sizes.\n",
      "Looks nice with our whiskey decanter on it. Great shine. Wish it was a bit bigger\n",
      "The tray is beautiful, just as pictured.  I bought two.  It is the perfect size.  For Christmas Eve, I have placed 10 stemless wine glasses on one, and 10 Christmas coffee cups on the other.  It looks more expensive than it is.  Very pleased with the tray.\n",
      "I absolutely love this little honey pot with stick.  I can easily store my honey in there and add it to toast or tea or whatever.  It's a great addition to my kitchen.\n",

      "Beautiful tray. Perfect for my ottoman\n",
      "Very very nice, looks expensive in person!\n",
      "This is so shiny you could use it as a mirror. On occasion we overfill our keurig (personal size) and it overflows.  I was concerned the marble and wood on our coffee bar could get damaged but didn't want to use something that would take away from the lovely piece of furniture.  This was the perfect solution.  It is more solid and heavier than I expected for such a low price which was a nice surprise.  At night the dark sky and street lights reflect off of the tray through the kitchen window and it glows with a lovely cobalt blue color.\n",
      "pretty but surface scratches very easily\n",
      "Great addition to our bar area. Bigger than I thought.\n",
      "Nice. Basically looks as pictured, might be slightly darker. Good product.\n",
      "I was surprised at how shiny this was when I opened it.  Much better than I expected. Basically a mirror finish. Like others, This  is now used to show off my favorite decanter and matching rocks glasses. And it makes them look even more spectacular than they are. I'm very pleased, especially considering it was only 20 bucks. I would highly recommend it.\n",
      "Should have bought this with the set.\n",
      "Nice for the price!\n",
      "This was a gift for my son.  I sent this tray along with a decanter set.  He liked the tray.  Really pretty.  It is very shiny and made the decanter set sparkle.\n",
      "I bought 2 of these lovely trays.  Very pleased with how pretty they are.  I may use one on my dresser but they would be great to carry in snacks, drinks, etc. when company is over.  Very reasonable price and fast shipping, as always with Amazon.  Highly recommend.\n",
      "After reading the insert that comes with the item, it actually states that it's Zinc plated and not 'silver plated material'.  Now, maybe the blend has 1-5% silver in it or something but since the product description is misleading, I felt it needs a 4 star.\n",
      "\n",
      "  That being said, it is shiny and for anyone not familiar with a true silver tray or other item, they might not notice the difference and it does cut down on quite a bit of work since I don't have to polish it all the time like a true silver item.  I've had it for a few weeks in a high humidity climate and mine hasn't discolored one bit like other reviewers stated (though maybe they got the silver plated versions).\n",
      "This is a lovely serving tray which I have placed in my dining room bar. If you are looking for something simple, yet elegant, then this is the tray for you!\n",
      "Item scratched within the first minutes of use. I experimented and dragged a bottle of Whiskey on it and it scratched. YES PEOPLE, IT SCRATCHED! I'm not sure what the material it is coated with, but I assure you that this will not help you keep up with appearances after all of the unsightly scratches they accumulate.\n",

      "These trays are amazing.  I have now purchased three. I even have one in the bathroom featuring bath products. Absolutely beautiful!\n",
      "i bought this for my bathroom sink top.  a pot of orchid and pretty home fragrance bottles sit on top of it and i would have to say it really lit up my bathroom.  Very good buy and really good price\n",
      "These trays are simply beautiful. I use them constantly and they retain the sheen and beauty. I get many compliments from family members.\n",
      "I bought this for my chrome accent master bathroom, as a vanity tray. Looks great. Only defect is around the corners are a little jagged, I can only tell where it's been soldered to blend smoothed corners. It's not noticeable from a few inches away. Inspector Gadget over here.\n",
      "This is very pretty and has a beautiful shine. It was purchased to place vase of flowers on top. My measures indicate 11-1/2 by 16-1/4, but 11x16 is close enough for government work.\n",
      "I have displayed this item in my home bar and it's a very classic look and a conversation piece for visitors.\n",
      "Great size, too. I purchased this to use for hors d'oeuvres, nibbles, etc, and it's just about perfect. Cleans easily, is relatively sturdy, too. For a tray that cost less than 20 dollars when I purchased it, it's a super buy. OK, so it's not Wallace Silver quality, but I wasn't expecting that. In fact, I can honestly say that this exceeded my expectations by a large margin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very happy with this purchase!\n",
      "These trays stained quickly and I was never able to clean them. I would not recommend them. They were not a quality product.\n",
      "Beautiful and even nicer in person. I got this for a set of flameless candles and it looks just beautiful. It shines beautifully and fits perfectly for where I wanted it.\n",
      "I really can't believe how reasonably priced this tray is. It's a good size and nice and heavy. The finish is a bright, mirrored silver. I'm using it for a holiday centerpiece for the coffee table, filling it with glittered ornaments and pillar candles. It ended up looking better than expected - mostly due to the quality of the tray. I would totally buy this again.\n",
      "I DON'T UNDERSTAND why this received such GREAT REVIEWS????!!!! I've had this LESS than a DAY and I ALREADY ORDERED A DIFFERENT TRAY for my Coffee Table and this is going into the GARBAGE!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes its pretty, but that quickly FADES when you go to put a Decanter Set on and it IMMEDIATELY SCRATCHES!!!! I'm not ROUGH with my items but this thing SCRATCHES AT THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH!!!! And if your a NEAT FREAK that CAN'T STAND LOOKING AT FINGERPRINT SMUDGES you NEED to PASS ON THIS, there is NO POSSIBLE WAY of TOUCHING this tray WITHOUT WIPING it DOWN after EVERY SINGLE TIME unless you have a pair of POLISHING GLOVES ON!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "This thing is SO CHEAP there ARE NO FELT PADS OR RUBBER BUMPERS ON THE BOTTOM TO STOP THE TRAY FROM SLIDING ALL OVER THE SURFACE, so each time you go to grab either the glasses or the decanter the tray slides all over the coffee table!!! Then you go to move the tray back and now the fingerprint smudges are all over it again!!!! IT'S LIKE A NEVER ENDING VICIOUS CYCLE OF SLIPPING, SLIDING, SCRATCHES AND SMUDGES!!!! Unless you like to WASTE MONEY or you plan on using this just ONCE and then THROWING IT IN THE TRASH AFTER; I really don't see this being a decent product even for the price!!! I found a faux crocodile pewter tray with silver handles for $18 somewhere else!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "BOTTOM LINE: JUNK!!!!\n",
      "The tray was very glamorous! I like it a lot, and the price was not to bad either, it would be much more in a furniture store. Great gift for any female as it can be used for a lot of things.\n",
      "For the price this tray has made a nice addition to our buffet. We have a decanter and tumblers sitting on top of it. It really dresses things up.\n",
      "Have to warn you this scratches easily. If you take care it is a lovely tray. works beautifully for a decanter & highball glasses\n",
      "These trays are gorgeous, elegant, shiny, have some weight to it, and are perfect for serving beverages. I'm very happy with this product.\n",
      "I like this simple, shiny silver tray.  It's obviously not real silver, but for the price, I really like it.\n",
      "I bought this as a gift for a friend.  She wanted something to put on her dining room side board to display a whiskey decanter and her glasses.  She was thrilled. Also, great price.\n",
      "We use this to place our whiskey decanter and glasses and looks really nice. It doesn't get dirty as quickly as i thought it might and easy to clean. It is nice and heavy for price.\n",
      "This is a great item at a great price.  It dresses up my cognac set perfectly and makes it nice and portable.  There isn't much else to say about a rectangle tray.  It speaks for itself.\n",
      "I put my whiskey decanter and some glasses on this on a side table that was in between two wingback chairs.  It's large enough to put several bottles and a few glasses on it.  It's very shiny, almost mirror-like.  I posted a pic, it holds a lot of things...\n",
      "Item arrived very quickly in excellent condition.  Easily trimmed and installed in well under an hour. If installed on tile, you will need to use or purchase a masonry drill bit (not provided).  Just cut the rod to the proper size and drill the mounting holes per the instructions provided.  Once your finished you will have more arm and elbow room for sure.  Great!\n",
      "I'm very happy with this rod.  It matches my oil-rubbed bronze fixtures perfectly, and the curved design looks very upscale and gives extra room in the shower.  There are end caps that cover the mounting hardware, and they were a little stubborn to get them to stay put, but it looks great.\n",
      "I'm really happy with this tray; certainly can't beat the price, and it looks very  nice supporting a set of crystal whiskey glasses.\n",
      "We bought this to go on a wine rack/table and to place a crystal whiskey set on it.  It looks great!  Good quality, great price and value.  Easy to keep shiny, too.\n",
      "I got this and have had it for a while and it looks great with a good decanter and some glasses on it. The light shines off it and it sparkles. The only problem is that it can actually stain from booze dribble. We had some drips from whisky and it was underneath the decanter. When we cleaned it, there were lines from the drip. Not terrible but kinda disappointing. I guess thats what you get for a 20 buck tray.\n",
      "I was looking for a silver tray to display on top our liquor/wine cabinet. This ended up being exactly what we wanted. It fit perfectly.  My husband makes his drinks on it and it keeps our cabinet from getting ruined.  There does appear to already be a small stain already on the tray, but since it was pretty cheap i'm not going to complain.  It looks nice overall.\n",
      "Matches Kohler fixtures in chrome. Kohler does not make these and Kohler recommends Moen for shower rods.  Came unscratched even though it was not shipped w/padding/bubble wrap. I was lucky.\n",
      "Great product. I use this in all new apt renovations.\n",
      "Great quality and exactly as described.\n",
      "Very sturdy, well made and attractive.  I am 100% pleased with my purchase.\n",
      "Don't settle for the adjustable shower rods with the annoying ridge that the shower rings have to jump over every time.  Get the rod that works flawlessly every time.\n",
      "Great item. exactly as described\n",
      "Excellent curtain rod, solid robust, looks nice!  Had to make the rod a little smaller and so cut off a very small section.  Otherwise, installation was easy.  The family and I love this new curved curtain rod.\n",
      "Seems solid and nicely made.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately it would not work for our application. Because the rail overhangs the area outside the tub, when the shower curtain is closed it overhangs anything next to the tub, in our case the toilet, making the bathroom seem that much more cramped. It would however be a good solution for a slightly more spacious bathroom.\n",
      "xcvxzcv\n",
      "The best shower rod I ever owned, smooth travel, no joints to snag hooks. Just happened to fit our new bathroom and no alterations needed.\n",
      "Looks great in our guest bath, nice and easy upgrade\n",
      "This shower curtain was great. Makes it feel like the shower is twice as big as it is. It gives an extra six inches of room between the wall and curtain but believe me that it feels like a mile! It was a little long but I cut it with a sawzall and made it fit perfectly. If you need to do that just make sure to cut at the same angle it has or it won't fit the bracket properly.\n",
      "This shower rod is very nice. My husband installed it where we had another rod previously. It was an easy install and looks very nice. Very good quality.\n",
      "Very fashionable!!!! Gives you at lot more room in the shower!\n",
      "I read the other reviews and they said it was easy to put up - they were right.  You just follow the directions and it goes in place just like you knew what you were doing.\n",
      "Was easy to install.  Looks great.  Been three months and no rust.\n",

      "Easy to install, beautiful. So far, no rusting (fingers crossed!)\n",
      "This product shipped and was received in good time.  However, you must make sure your space is 5 foot as there is no room for wiggle.  We returned this product and bought an adjustable one instead.\n",
      "I bought this shower rod in August 2012 for my new apartment.  It's still standing strong, and giving me tons of extra elbow room in my shower.  I even have two Bengal cats who went through a phase where they loved to climb the cheap shower curtain I had hanging from it, and it never wavered.  I highly recommend.  I'll buy it again when I move.\n",
      "My daughter loves this shower curtain rod. It was easy to install and adds extra space to the shower area.\n",
      "So the rod and the covers on both sides are excellent.  Even the mounting plates work excellent.  The screws and the dry wall anchors that help hold it in place just don't work.  They are cheap and bend super easy. Ended up buying other ones from home depot, then it worked great!\n",
      "Used this in my new basement bathroom. I have a curved shower rod in my guest bathroom and it is amazing how much extra room this gives you/\n",
      "Moen is an excellent brand. The price was right the shipping quick\n",
      "I have mixed feelings about this shower curtain rod. It's nice to have more space in the shower but for the rest of the time the bathroom feels cramped. I will buy a regular shower curtain rod next time.\n",
      "This adds a nice touch of luxury to a simple bathroom.  Having a curved rod doesn't take space away from the bathroom, but definitely adds space to the shower.  I had one guest say she prefers this kind of curved bars to even sliding glass shower doors.\n",
      "This shower rod allows more room in your shower. It is easy to install if you are even not so handy.\n",
      "Installation was relatively easy, but after about a year, little rust marks appeared on the bottom side of the rod. This is in a fully ventilated bathroom with a shower window and ceiling exhaust. I ignore the rusty spots, but if you're pick, you may want to look elsewhere.\n",
      "Fell in love with this concept while traveling for work.  It really gives a few extra inches for your elbows and makes a big difference, especially in a small tub.  Combine this with a hookless shower curtain and you have an exquisite little retreat right at home!\n",
      "This Curved shower rod works like a charm.  Mounting the unit was very easy and sturdy.  Looks just like the ones in the hotels.\n",
      "This is just so much nicer than the plastic expandable tension rod.  It was not hard to hang up but you need two people to install it for sure.  Read the directions and measure measure measure!!  The only thing that keeps me from giving this 5 star is not REALLY a problem with the rod but my bathroom.  It pushes the curtain further out from the tub - which it's supposed to.  However my sink sits pretty close to my tub - it's tight quarters.  So now the shower curtain catches in the drawer all the time and I really hate it.  It's a minor inconvenience except for I bought a nice curtain that has now gotten all snagged up :(  The directions about hanging the rod are very focused on getting you to put it up right over the ledge of the tub where a normal rod would mount - they never get you to check the clearance of anything else in the room.\n",
      "I bought this because it said that it resisted rust. Low and behold there is already rust on the product and it's only been a year. This issue is compounded by the fact that this is no easy cookie to install. I am pretty sure that, even with reading the instructions and having two people to install it, I still installed it wrong and I do not look forward to attempting to uninstall it. It looks great. But low lifespan for so much money.\n",
      "You will need to cut the rod to length if your shower is narrower than the rod length. The upside is that it will be very strong. I would suggest using screw-in drywall anchors to make it a bit easier. Cut it to length (if needed), use your shower curtain to tell how high to put it and then use a level to locate it correctly; mark the hole location with a pencil, install drywall anchors, slide the trim on and hang the rod. Very strong and looks good too!\n",
      "We received a rod with METAL brackets - not plastic as the other reviewers mentioned (not sure if this is new or old style?).\n",
      "\n",
      "The box claims this rod is formed from stainless steel - which should be very important as I see reviews for OTHER rods mention bad rust developing before long.  This rod is also much sturdier than another style we purchased from a retail store.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very happy and would purchase this again.\n",
      "I can't express how great it is to have a curved shower curtain rod. Makes it seem like there's so much extra room in the shower now.\n",
      "Bought this rod to install in my newly remodeled bathroom. My husband likes the fact that it gives him extra room in the shower.\n",
      "This is the hotel experience right in your very own home.  Makes a roomy shower in a bathroom with a tub-shower combo.  We love it.  Guests love it.  We'll keep it!\n",
      "I bought this two years ago and installed it in our guest bathroom. Installation was straightforward, it looks nice, and guest enjoy the extra room in the shower provided by this curved shower rod.\n",
      "Great product and cost.\n",
      "This is not adjustable so make sure it will fit your space before ordering. We didn't want an adjustable one, so the shower curtain doesn't get \"stuck\" at the spot where it adjusts.\n",
      "Easy to install and looks great!\n",
      "Purchased two of these, one for each bathroom.  It is amazing how much bigger the showers seem now.  Easy to install (did it myself) and sturdy.\n",
      "This shower rod looks great and provides a little extra elbow room in the shower without making our bathroom seem smaller. This is the retail version of this rod and I HIGHLY recommend it over the contractor model, which while cheaper had plastic fasteners. This rod came with heavy duty fasteners and metal brackets, so that when our two year old tugs on the shower curtain I don't have to worry about the rod coming down on top of her.\n",
      "These curved rods do not work with the popular walk-in shower pans, but if you shower in a tub, then this is a MUST.  My tub shower is so roomy now, and I purchased a curtain with a window to let in more light which made it even better.  I'm still a fan of super shiny chrome faucets, so I bought this curved rod in chrome to coordinate with the other hardware in the bathroom.  It's not adjustable, so there's no awkward place in the middle of the rod for your shower curtain to get snagged on.  I'm hoping this rod lasts a while, considering the frequent high humidity.  Overall, very attractive and makes showering more pleasant. Note: if your toilet is close to your tub and you like your fabric curtains to hang outside the tub, then this rod will crowd the toilet area.\n",
      "These are pretty, and functional, easy to put up and they add style to the bathrooms. Good product for. Good price\n",
      "Looks very cool and gives more room in the tub. Nicely made! High quality and I now have in both baths.\n",
      "I really like this product it was easy to install even though I had to trim about a 1/2\" from the length. I just marked the rod where it needed to be trimmed being careful to preserve the original angle,clamped it securely and cut it with a sawsall. What a difference it made as to the room in the shower area, should have done it sooner.\n",
      "Now that I've installed one, I'm sure I could do another one in less than half the time. This shower curtain rod is sturdy and looks nice. It's the right size for a standard tub width.\n",
      "Love that we don't have the curtain getting hung up on the rod anymore. This was a two person job so it is level and easier. Installation was easy as long as you pay attention. It took use less than 30 minutes.\n",
      "This bar is a one piece design, very heavy mounting brackets, first class construction, lifetime warranty, easy to install, mounting parts are included...\n",
      "We cut to size and works well. Gives just a little more room, but definitely notice the extra room! Would recommend.\n",
      "Very nice looking, great price, but it didn't fit either of my bathrooms.  I had to return both rods I ordered.\n",
      "It took me a little while to get it cut and mounted but it is very solid with no movement or flex. It also supplies a good bit more shoulder room in the shower. Only thing that could make it better is if it came with some kind of template to cut the end at the proper angle.\n",
      "I had to cut the rod down as it was 11/2 inches too long for my shower. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. Nice chrome, solid wall brackets and it makes the shower roomier and brighter. Love it!\n",
      "very nice, you feel you have more room in the shower, look nice, not cheap looking,  very sturdy was  able to adjust to fit in my new bathroom\n",
      "Instructions were easy to read and follow, installation was a breeze, and product works great.  Make sure your opening is the right size and this shower rod will work great.\n",
      "I bought this Moen product for 2 reasons: the one-piece rod (tube, actually) & the all stainless steel construction. I am not disappointed. My installation required no shortening of the tube, so replacement of my old, straight rod took maybe 15 minutes, start-to-finish. The welded end posts provide very sturdy mounting with no sag or play. Instead of the wall anchors provided, I elected to use my own stainless steel screws to fasten into the wall studs. The end covers completely hide the mounts & old screw holes.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are available in several finishes. I got the chrome & am happy with it, but would've preferred white to match my Moen towel bars/rings had it been available.\n",
      "Best thing we ever put in our bathroom.  Husband installed it with ease and it's like adding a foot of space to our shower!\n",

      "This shower curtain resists rust very well. I had some curtain rings rust on top of this shower rod but it didn't spread to the rod. It did stain the top a little but it held up very well. After the rings rusted I decided to rub some WD40 on the rod so I don't know how the rod holds up over time without a rust deterrent.\n",

As this is a complete remodel install, making sure the width was Exactly 5' (or 6') was easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did not use the supplied drywall screws, as I know we put 2x4 there ;) Quite expansive. I didn't know amazon had this model until I got it elsewhere. I was so twisted around about the various choices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Measure accurately, if it is exactly 5' or 6', it is a great rod.\n",
      "I love the added space the curved shower rod provices.  Seems odd for awhile not rubbing up against the curtain all the time.  I got both the brushed nikle and the chrome and found little difference over time(1yr).  They both wear on the top even when using the beraring style(which I also recomend) curtain hooks, but will say you will never have the nasty drag you remember from a plain rod and scraping hook.  All things are going to wear over time and the rods do also but you cannot see the wear unless you look down at it so I guess the issue is minimal.  I found it easy to install but would note that it does not specify the size of drill to use.  I went 2 sizes smaller on the drill bit than the anchor and it tapped in nicely with a small rubber hammer.  I also could not find it cheaper than amazon at any of the local stores so I ordered it here.  If you've never used a curved rod before I know you will like it too.  Do not mount the rod outside the edge of the tub/shower or you will have way more room than you want.\n",
      "We put this in my husband's bathroom and he says it makes his shower seem so much roomier. It was very easy to put up, as well.\n",
      "We bought this shower curtain rod for our guest bathroom.  It looks nice and was easy to install.  I think everyone should have this type.  It makes a huge difference in how much room you have when showering.  After installing this rod and a new 5 inch Kohler shower head our guests will love their showers now.\n",
      "Really loved the nickel brushed curtain. It was very easy to install and adjust to every bathroom. I am going to buy another for my mother in-law\n",
      "It was a beautiful rod AT FIRST.  After about 3 months rust began to appear and now it's just another cheap looking bathroom fixture that needs to be replaced.  Because of the rough texture of the rust when you pull the curtain across often as not some of the hooks jump off the rod.  I would never recommend this rod.  If you don't care about the rust I'm sure you can find a cheaper rod that will rust for much less money.\n",
      "When I moved into a new house, I wanted a curved shower rod.  The look of the bathroom dictated getting a bronzed color.  After almost three years of use, this has help up great.  Installation was easy, it looks great, and it still looks like new despite having metal hooks being used multiple times a day on it.\n",
      "Easy to install and looks really nice. We used our own drywall anchors as suggested by other reviewers. Lots more space in the shower now\n",
      "The shower rods seems to be holding up great.  I was a little concerned about how it would take being in a moist environment every day, but it is doing well and not showing any signs of rusting or marking from the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was very easy to install.  The brackets are easy to line up and the rod comes with anchors that are easy to install after drilling common sized holes.  I hit a stud on two of the holes on one side, so be sure to use a very small drill bit first to see if you have a stud present before drilling the large size hole to accept the anchor.  The decorative ends snap right on to the base plates.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a standard size tub/shower (standard being what a typical contractor would install in typical home) so the rod fit exactly without needing to be cut.  If you think you have an \"oversize\" shower, you may find this rod to be too short.  Any smaller than \"standard\" and you simply cut it down to size.\n",
      "didn't really work in my application, caused the curtain to stick out too much and my toilet is located right next to my tub, therefore making it a little claustrophobic when going to take a poo. Glad I tested it out before I installed it. I didn't return the thing, its sitting in my basement up in the rafters collecting dust. A shame, really.\n",
      "This is a quality shower rod that is easy to install and very solid once it's up.  I had to cut the rod a bit shorter with a hacksaw, which was easy to do (I used the old rod as a guide to where to cut the new rod to length).  I used waterproof deck screws to put up the brackets.  Once up, the rod is rock-solid, looks great and is easy to use.  I'm very pleased with this product.\n",
      "Bought this because I was sick and tired of being attacked by the shower curtain! This rod was fairly easy to install, but please note that this is NOT a tension-set rod, and that you are mounting this to your wall! Only issue I have is that there is a slight discoloring happening on the underside of the rod where water and soap residue collect. Most of it cleans off, but there still is a slight dark color from the chemical reaction. This doesn't bother me, but if it might bother you, you might want to opt for a stainless instead of the nickel.\n",
      "This shower rod is attractive, durable and provides ample room in the shower.  Very pleased with the product and am glad I invested in it!\n",
      "We were thrilled to find out that this shower rod was all stainless steel.  It won't rust, and I am surprised this isn't in the description.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a beautifully made product.  The supports are heavy and welded.  The rod is super smooth and the pieces are shiny.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are really picky, polished stainless steel is not the same color as chrome.  It is a warm silver while chrome is a cool silver.  With three feet between the shower rod and the chrome towel rods, I can't see the difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Installation wasn't hard, but my husband is handy and we have lots of tools.  The included anchor bolts are great quality, but you will need wood screws if you are screwing into a stud.\n",
      "\n",
      "The measurement is exact which is great for stability.  If your distance is smaller, you could saw part of the ends off since it is stainless.  To look best, you would need to saw some off of each end.\n",
      "\n",
      "The space the curved rod adds is huge.  I had no idea it would make such a difference.  In fact, I might have had my husband move it a couple of inches in if I had known.  My husband says that the rod is so sturdy and so well designed that the house would fall down first.  That means the rod stays where it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've never had a shower curtain slide so easily.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great quality.\n",
      "So convenient to order via Amazon. Arrived in perfect condition. I had read other reviews and measured the opening this is NOT adjustable, can not shorten without cutting, I was aware of that, but only because another reviewer mentioned, could be important for you. Also, some of the less expensive ones were incomplete and did not have the wall brackets. So, don't just look at the price when shopping, look for the complete package, and this fits the bill.\n",
      "I got this to give myself a little more elbow room in the shower. It works great. I stay in a lot of hotels, and they all have these curved rods. I decided I needed one at home and couldn't be happier. It was a painless install, maybe 15 minutes with a drill and hammer. I put it above the tiles in my shower into the drywall for easier installation. I just wish that my curtains were a few inches longer now. A great product, but does show some slight signs of marring. I haven't really tried to clean it yet, but if I did it would probably have to be after every couple of showers to keep it new looking.\n",
      "I looked all over locally for these fixed-length curved shower rods, and couldn't find them anywhere!  The only thing anyone stocked was the adjustable rods.  I prefer the fixed length because my curtain rings don't get hung up on the \"lip\" created by the adjustable rod, and it simply looks nicer and more professional.  I was thrilled to find them at such a great price on Amazon.  I ordered two of these, and they installed like a dream!  I saw one reviewer comment that they were unhappy because \"no shower is exactly 60\" wide.\"  Ours installed with absolultely no issues, and the brackets do allow for a total of 1\" variance, which is adequate in most circumstances.  The rods also arrived within a week, which was fantastic, and helped our remodel move along faster.  The finishes are beautiful, and my two updated baths look amazing.  This is the only way to go for a shower rod!\n",
      "We took down shower doors and put up this rod and love the difference!! You now have plenty of elbow room when you shower without hitting anything. Went up easily with the included instructions and we were able to adjust the length to fit our area after cutting the bar.\n",
      "This was extremely easy to install - it took me longer to hang the shower curtain than it did to install the bar to the wall.  It uses 4 anchors, I suggest you upgrade from the cheap anchors they provide with some wing-its brand anchors or toggle bolts if you're not in a stud.\n",
      "\n",
      "This added about 8 inches of arm room for me and my shower liner no longer comes into the tub and sticks to me which I find gross and annoying.  There is now enough room for me to chicken dance in the shower without my elbows hitting the wall OR the curtain.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would be careful if you have a light over top the shower edge now that the shower curtain will now block the light into the bathroom - this has caused my toilet area to be a little bit darker because the light is now more in the shower than split over both.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall this was a great purchase and I would recommend it (especially at this price) to anybody!\n",
      "This shower curtain rod is great quality and looks amazing.  My previous rod was an expandable rod so it had a bump in the middle of it, it made opening the curtain wide hard to do because it would get stuck on that bump.  This new rod is one continuous bar and now my curtain opens very easy.  It fit my shower perfectly too, I have a 59\" wide space there.  It also makes my shower seem twice as big now that the rod curves outward.  Money very well spent here making my bathroom look nicer.\n",
      "This rod works but it wall base plate attachment is plastic, only the top or bottom of the end covers snap on the base plate but not both, and limited wall anchor choices. Many modern houses utilize advanced framing techniques that use 5/8\" sheetrock on the 2x6 exterior walls. The anchors (molly bolts) are minimally expectable for 1/2\" sheetrock but do not work on 5/8\". I don't think this will last that well as the shower curtain is tugged on over time. Its consumer grade junk!\n",
      "The rod is perfect for the bathroom.  However, the installation kit came with 4 screws and there are 6 holes to screw in on each side.  But the 4 screws are strong enough to hold the pole in place.  I would recommend this product to a friend.\n",
      "I'd been looking for a one piece curve4d curtain rod for some time. I bought two rods but when they arrived they were two piece so I had to return them. I finally ordered this rod and it was what I was looking for. No splice in the middle to catch on the curtain rings and installation was very quick and straight forward.\n",
      "I can't believe how good this shower rod is.  I know it seems weird to have a curved shower rod when you have a standard bathroom, but they really make a difference.  The bathroom feels a lot bigger now than before.  The only complaint I have is with Amazon, they shipped the package without any box.  When this item got to my house, the package was all dented.  Luckily, no damage.....\n",
      "Did require a little cutting, but the directions are clear and the bar is everything they advertised. Looks great and I expect it to function and shine for years. I consider it a great buy.\n",
      "Had seen these curved rods in various hotels, and decided to try one at home. Moen generally produces good to excellent quality appliances, and this shower rod is up to their expected standards. The product measurements are accurate, and the rod was installed easily. Buyers should be aware that they will need a few simple tools (drill, screw driver) to set it up. Once the curtain is installed, it will provide a significantly larger showering area than a traditional straight rod/curtain. Very good product!\n",
      "Should have bought this 3 years ago when we bought the house. We LOVE it. We mainly bought it so our future tenants won't have to worry about getting a tension rod and after my husband put it up, he was like \"why didn't I get one of these sooner???\"\n",
      "I purchase a curve shower rod at Home Depot, that one was a 1 piece and the shower hangers out get caught using that rod. So I return that rod and purchase this Moen from Amazon. It's a 1 piece show rod, no problems installing it and because its a 1 piece rod, the shower hangers move smoothly. I also purchase this with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Moen-SR2201BN-Shower-Ring-Brushed-Nickel/dp/B0053H5BFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Moen SR2201BN Shower Ring, Brushed Nickel</a>&nbsp;another fine quality item. Trust me I am like most that try to find the best price and best deal, but sometimes it's better to pay a few dollars more for a better quality product.\n",
      "Just finished changing out all the fixtures in my bathroom for a quick update.  Chose this brushed nickel Moen rod to match the rest of the items. Looks beautiful.  It was very easy to install and the plate nicely covered the holes in the wall from the old rod. I thought I would have to trim this rod because from wall to wall my shower measured 4ft 10 3/4 inches. To my surprise this 5 ft rod fit perfectly - no trimming needed.  The rod itself is a nice solid quality and has a nice finished look.\n",
      "Just did a master bath remodel, it's so stunning that it should be in a decor magazine.  This shower rod matched all my other brushed nickel hardware exactly and added a touch of elegance.  Though it has to fit exactly as it is not adjustable, it is awesome not to have the seam that makes the shower curtain hooks jump off the rod each time you open or close the curtain.  Definitely recommend this item.\n",
      "This is a great looking rod! I did not know how pretty it looks until I finished the installation! The material and the shape really adds beauty to the bathroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "The installation maye take you a while if you have a stoned shower wall. I had travertine, and the installation took me about an hour. Drilling the 6 holes on the two walls (3 holes each) took the most time. You would need to get a 3/16\" masonary drill, anchor, stainless screw.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advice: before you drill on the wall, put a masking tape on the wall. Otherwise the drill bit will slide on the wall. Use 3/16\" drill bit and size #10 anchor. The anchor needs to be exact size #10, too small will not grab, too large will not stay. Use stainless screws otherwise they will rust over time.\n",
      "This shower rod is very good.  It fit my shower perfectly, had the appropriate mounting hardware, installed pretty easily, and looks great.\n",
      "\n",
      "My only issue was that installing the round end pieces that cover up the mounting brackets was not as straightforward and resulting in my rotating it excessively as I tried to get it to lock into place, and the sharp edge of the cover cutting a circle in the paint like a cookie cutter. This is mostly hidden by the cover, but it does show slightly on the bottom side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, this was likely my fault for not understanding how it clicked into place and being too forceful with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall a great product.\n",
      "This rod is a great upgrade from an \"Adjustable\" rod.  The shower glides from end to end without the catch you get with the adjustable rods.  It is worth the trouble to saw off part to make it fit non-standard shower/tub openings.  The quality is very high and you can just see the quality of the rod before you even use it.  I highly recommend it.\n",
      "I realy realy like this product. Everything from timely receipt and condition of product. Installed fairly easily for me ( even by myself), as I did not place it where it had to be cut, which actually brought it out a little further than expected. I have always been a Moen customer and am still. They fully back their products and one quick phone call and they will ship you free, any replacement part of their products that may break from usuage over time. My home is 11 years old and my kitchen faucet acted up a short time ago and they had me a replacement part(s)in 2 days! No shipping or parts cost to me. Their product garantee of their products is impeccable. I really like this product. It gave me tons of extra room in my shower without always touching the shower curtain. My only regret is I only bought one. I will most likely buy another for an inner shower curtain, and a double bar one for my spare bathroom.\n",
      "I have a one piece acrylic bath/shower unit.  As such this rod fit perfectly as it must with this standard type of bath.  If you have a porcelain tub with separate tile, marble or plastic surround you may need to modify this rod.  You can shorten it but there is no way to make it longer.  Also making the correct miter cuts could be problematic.\n",
      "One piece sturdy SS rod.  Pretty easy to install.  Remember to measure twice and cut once.  Makes a big difference in shower roominess.\n",
      "My wife and I are finishing a complete bathroom remodel and in the final stages of selecting the shower rod, towel holder, and toilet paper holder.  We looked at a number of shower rods and selected this brushed-nickel, curved Moen rod due to its style.  It was a nice change from the standard straight shower rods you see everywhere else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moen does a nice job to help make installation as easy as possible.  The instructions contain a mounting template for each end of the shower rod.  If the wall has studs, on the template they show you where to drive your wood screws.  If you're mounting to drywall with no stud underneath, they show you where to drill the hole for the wall anchors.  They provide six wall anchors (three per side), but, strangely, they don't provide the wood screws.  This confused me, but it wasn't a show stopper.  Just be aware that, if you will be installing this into studs, you'll have to supply your own screws.\n",
      "\n",
      "Installation was fairly simple and is best done by two people--one to do the drilling/screwing and the other to hold the rod.  The rod swings widely on its plastic mounts, so you can separate both ends and piece them together, if you decide to separate them and mount one side first, then the other.  This allows for an easier install rather than someone holding the entire rod while the first side is being mounted.  When mounting is complete, the end caps snap over the mounting plate to provide a clean and very professional finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall we're very pleased with this product.  Moen has a reputation for making quality products and this shower rod is no exception.  Our bathroom remodel found us selecting Moen products for the shower, sink, and shower rod, and we couldn't be happier with how this rod perfectly matches up with all the other Moen fixtures in our bathroom.\n",
      "Arrived as promised. Installed in less than 30 minutes. Seems to work fine. In the future, I will buy one that is an adjustable length, not fixed length as this one. Although cutting the relatively thin metal is easy to adjust the length, cutting at the correct angle to fit the decorative covers and mounts is beyond my technical skill.\n",
      "This was fairly simple to install. My only complaint is that they don't include screws for insertion into a stud (they only include molly-bolts for use with drywall). Luckily we had a few in the garage. I'd recommend this shower-bar concept--the bar gives you elbow-room in the shower, and it looks pretty, too. I bought shower curtain rings with the little balls above to make them slide easier. Looks great.\n",
      "1 piece rod with good hardware.  Once mounted properly it feels very sturdy.  It looks great as well.\n",
      "A beautiful rod. I was updating the guest bathroom with oil rubbed bronze.  It goes beautiful with all the other fixures. I had a contracter install it.  It appeared to go up rather easily.\n",
      "We love it and the extra room.  My husband said it was easy to install. It fit perfectly.  The shipping was fast.\n",
      "I think they were .5 ounces larger than I anticipated, (might be my own mis-measuring).  But a very welcome addition to my misenplace!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Good quality stainless.  Highly recommended.\n",
      "I have a habit of wanting to take condiment cups home from restaurants because I love them, especially for portion control. My husband never lets me, and decided I should just find some on Amazon.  Finding these was awesome! They work perfectly for what I need and go right in the dishwasher, no problem!\n",
      "These things rust, and some are not smooth, bad quality. A couple rust right after I hand washed them.\n",
      "I use these as I gather and measure all the ingredients (spices, etc.) for a recipe. I especially like how they stack neatly and take up hardly any space in the cupboard.\n",
      "Did you know these are a great developmental toy for babies and toddlers? My granddaughter loves them! Now that she's bit older she can stack them together and pretend to drink from them. Nice and smooth stainless steel and is of a sturdy thickness and weight.\n",
      "These cups are very thin stainless steel and the dimensions per the item description are different that what I received.  Maybe they were packaged incorrectly but the cup could not hold 2.5 ounces of liquid.  The actual measurements were 1.5 inches tall, 2 1/8 inch diameter mouth and 1 3/8 inch diameter bottom.\n",
      "Great for condiments such as sauces or ketchup.\n",
      "We use these for syrup and other condiments for our little one. They are SO HANDDY!!!! They are sturdy and have not bent in the 2 years we have owned them. They have held up perfectly even through the dishwasher.\n",
      "Looks great works great. Hopefully save us some money on the disposables\n",
      "A few people have said these Condiment sauce cups leave black residue or rust after washing however when I recieved these I soaked them over night and ran twice through my Dishwasher on the top shelf and I had no issues at all. I have worked in many resturants in the past and these are pretty much in comparison to the ones in Resturants or at least close. Believe me I did alot of the ordering through resturant suppliers and we paid about the same amount and the quality was about the same. I don't know how long these will last but I purchased them for our annual 4th of July party this Year .I like that our guest can put their sauces for dipping in these and also great for lobster and clam boils so everyone can have their own Condiment Cup with melted butter. These will look much more better than the cheaper plastic ones that just get tossed in the landfill. A great way to keep it green so to say. Easy to run a clean micro fiber cloth over each one to remove any finger prints and bring the shine back to them , really any cloth should do the trick.\n",
      "Good product. Small size and easy to clean. You can use these cups in many different ways. If I need to re-stock will order again.\n",
      "These are very good quality and so much easier to clean than plastic condiment cups.  These should last a really long time which makes them a much better deal than I first thought they were.\n",
      "These arrived on time and were packaged well. However I am returning them as they do NOT feel like stainless steel. A few of these cups had dented rims and ALL of them had a strange smell that remained after being washed three times.....they also continued to give off a black film. I noticed this as I washed and dried them by hand. There is no country of manufacture listed anywhere on these cups or their packaging and it also doesn't say they are stainless steel as given in the item description. I am disappointed with this purchase .\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Perfect for a lot of \"things\", my wife wants more.\n",
      "I should have read the dimensions more clearly. These are much smaller than I was anticipating. They do seem to be a quality product though.\n",
      "Works great for holding ingredients while cooking.\n",
      "These little cups are great for so many things. I use them for so much more than dipping!\n",
      "Exactly as photographed and described.  Great purchase\n",
      "I was not satisfied with these condiment containers.  They are made of good quality however the inside of the container has very slight grooves in it and when they arrived there was tons of dirt/buildup inside the cut and no matter how many times I washed them if I ran my finger along the inside there was still some dirt stuck in the grooves that would come off on my finger.  If the inside was a smooth solid finish then these would be a much better purchase.  I can't say for sure you wouldn't experience this with other cups, as it seems as though it is made by machining the inside, so it's possible you will experience this with any others.  For that I'd rather buy a ton of the disposable ones to know I'm not dipping into dirt when I use condiments.\n",
      "As advertised\n",
      "Not super high quality - but hey, at this price, what do you want? Good enough for the purposes I use them for. Would buy again.\n",
      "\n",
      "NOTE: the description says 2 and half oz - that is about 73ml, which would be almost 5 tablespoons. The actual capacity (I measured) is only 3 tablespoons, and that is all the way to the rim. So do take note if capacity matters for your purposes.\n",
      "These are so useful. Really great to have in kitchen.\n",
      "very handy for dips and sauces.\n",
      "It's neat but I should've bought a larger size as well.\n",
      "These are well made and are all uniform. I use them for food prep and they have helped immensely!\n",
      "A quality buy.\n",
      "These were easy to fill and keep warm in the oven. Took the hasssle out of keeping the butter dip warm. Will be using these for a long time to come.\n",
      "So far great little cups for condiments. Will review back after using for a few more months to make sure they hold up to repeated use and washes.\n",
      "Nice sauce cups, have held up well.\n",
      "Who thought a simple little condiment cup could change our dining!  It makes it so easy to dip corndogs or have a personal serving of ketchup or ranch for fries.  I also have used them to put a side of berries with my child's lunch.  Every time we use them for a party, people ask where I got them.  They clean easily in the dishwasher.\n",
      "I ordered these condiment cups for my art studio. I needed small cups for mixing paint. These will be great for mixing acrylics and also Watercolor washes! The cost of all twelve of these were less than the cost of just a couple paint cups. They are perfect for my uses and I would order them again!\n",
      "Worked great\n",
      "Great little cups for dip etc.\n",
      "These are supper and bigger then I was expecting.\n",
      "Couldn't find them at Walmart where originally purchased. That's why I shop here at Amazon thanks guys!\n",
      "I love using these instead to hold things I cut like minced garlic or minced parsley for cooking purposes.  Easy to clean.  Nice small cups.  I probably only needed 6 but they came in set of 24.\n",
      "Love love love, perfect size for my needs and excellent quality.  Using for dip and sauce sides.\n",
      "perfect prep cups for cooking or serving sauces\n",
      "Metal condiment cups like the ones you'd find in restaurants.  Fit and finish wasn't perfect on all of the cups.  Some had small dents and irregularities.\n",
      "Love the toaster . Great product.\n",
      "IT IS  a REFURBISHED TOASTER. WE GOT TRICKED!!\n",
      "Well, it breifly worked. One side is now burned out now and I don't make a lot of toast for a two person household without children. After my Cuisinart food processor blade recall (maybe I'll have a replacement by Easter...) this will be the last Cuisinart product that I will purchase.\n",
      "Great toaster, needed plastic outer covering but doesnt look cheap. Nice levers, dial numbers can be hard to read if its not directly at counter level. Toasts great.\n",
      "had it two months, right side quit toasting, left side takes too long to toast.\n",
      "Great to have around for many different uses. Good for condiments. Also for holding components that you measure out when getting ready to cook a meal.\n",
      "Love it!!!\n",
      "As described\n",
      "super price\n",
      "I originally purchased my set of sauce cups many years ago in a Pier One shop.  They were larger,  and they were also stainless steel.  After so many years,  I was down to two and so it was time to purchase some more  ...  So, I bought these.  When they arrived, I was initially very pleased.  I ran them through our dishwasher, and they came through that beautifully.  While putting them away,  it  became noticeable that they were lighter in feel to my original sauce cups.  On further comparison,  I found that they were also smaller,  and did not hold as much in volume.  Nevertheless, I'm very happy with my purchase, and I use these every day for meals for my children.  They love them also and I have to keep close eye on each one so they don't go waling off ...  so far, we're doing good and not missing any yet!  The neighborhood children love coming over and they really enjoy being invited for dinner.  They love these sauce cups.  I would purchase again....  For the price, they are well worth it!\n",
      "The only reason I bought this is because the carafe in my Mr. Coffee shattered, so I thought I would get a stainless carafe this time.  Cuisinart has nothing on Mr. Coffee.  This thing is just wrong, everything about is cheap and bad design.  The lid on the top I took my dremel to because it took to hands to flip open, seriously, what is the purpose in making that impossible to open.  Then the carafe, the lid flips up from the back and does not stay attached and it was to be re-inserted perfectly or it will come off when you pour.  It looks like a cheap plastic piece of crap.  If I paid full price, I would be returning it.  junk junk junk.\n",
      "This replaced a very old Krups 4 cupper which died.  In spite of reviews of the full price item, I decided I could not go far wrong with the refurbished one.  It works just fine! Brews good flavor coffee - I grind my own beans and like dark French roast.  It pours well, as opposed to the comments in other reviews.  I have been using it for a week now, and so far so good.  New Note - 3 weeks later!  This morning I had coffee all over the countertop.  The seller agreed to take it back (no charge to me) and refund my purchase price.  Needless to say I am disappointed, as the coffee was really good.\n",
      "good\n",
      "My wife and I use these a lot. Just perfect.\n",
      "Exactly the ones they use in restaurants. Perfect.\n",
      "They're exactly as listed. Small metal cups...\n",
      "as promised\n",
      "I use these for condiments along with the meal.  I'm weird, I do not like to drip ketchup all over fries - I prefer to dip the fry in the ketchup.  These work perfectly!  Awesome price too!\n",
      "Great toaster! I bought this as an identical replacement for one that I had for a number of years. The old one just wore out after everyday use.\n",
      "It was refurbished.. I understand that it's possible that there could be an issue.  However, I didn't expect for it to stop working within a week of purchase.  We returned this toaster and went out to purchase one at Target.  I don't recommend this one.\n",
      "I already own one and wanted to give the exact one to a friend.\n",
      "We have had this toaster for five years now and it's working wonderfully! The only complaint I have is that the defrost seeing seems to translate to BURN, but I only tried it once.\n",
      "Love this toaster; highly recommend it.\n",
      "8 years later and still works great.\n",
      "One of the twelve cups had a crack in it, but the others were great. Used them for a lobster boil, but will reuse for BBQs, etc.\n",
      "Perfect for personal cocktail and dipping sauces, hot or cold.\n",
      "Good stainless steel condiment cups there are lots of uses for these cups I like to put hot mustard  sauce in these cup besides mayo , ,chilipepper water , teriyaki sauce , and either or chop onion or chop garlic .\n",
      "Perfect size. Cleans easily and stacks.\n",
      "Nice quality and heavier than i had expected. Good size for condiments.  We use these things more than i thought we would. I would buy these again.\n",
      "Should Have Believed It.. IT DRIBBLES! I always read reviews, but generally like to form my own opinion of a product. This time, I must agree with the negative reviews about the decanter problem. It dribbles profusely, and not just a drop or two. Truly takes away from the enjoyment of my new coffeemaker. Too much trouble to return, so it sits on a shelf awaiting next garage sale.\n",
      "Only used it once and it worked perfect. Little difficult to remove basket for cleaning.\n",
      "As far as I know my in-laws use the coffeemaker daily and love it.  Easy for them to use and the results of a nicely brewed cup of Joe meets their expectations!  The price was so reasonable too.\n",
      "Bought this becaue the kids love to DIP.  For that, it's terrific. Also does a fairly decent job of cooking the waffles to the right done-ness, etc.  The beeper when they're done is very helpful for us busy moms.  All that said, the waffles are a little tough to get out sometimes, and often tear apart into the sticks during the process.  I'm an adult... I want mine to stick together so that I can pile on the fruit, etc.  It's also tough to get exactly the right amount of batter with the rectangular shape.  For adults, get a high quality ROUND belgian waffle iron - they're so much easier.\n",
      "This is a wonderful waffle stick maker.  Our grandkids love these waffle sticks.  They are the greatest.  This is a nice easy machine to clean up and the waffles do not stick.  The dipping containers are really great for kids, except the waffle maker should come with more of them for more kids. WE LOVE IT! If you have children, you need one of these!  BH\n",
      "This is a handy little fan. It's much less powerful than the 20x20 box fan I have, but is also half the size. I didn't read the reviews and didn't realize it was manually reversible. This means that there's on/off switches on each side of the fan, so if you manually flip the entire fan around to change if it's bringing air in vs. blowing air out, then you can control the speed or turn it off without flipping it back around. It's slightly handy, but not worth spending more money on this feature IMO because you could always just unplug a fan with an on/off switch on one side only to turn it off if you didn't want to remove it from the window.\n",
      "I love this fan. I bought it to bring in a breeze and cool down my second floor 2-story apartment when the weather is nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two speed settings allow for a bit of control.  The on/off/speed knob extends through the back side of the fan so that you can flip it around to face the other way and still control it.  This means you can either suck good air in when it's nice outside, or push bad air out when you've burned food on your stove.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are accordian-like panels that pull out from either side, allowing you to expand the entire device to fill up your window space.  This is a big plus for people who don't have screens; it keeps the bugs out, and keeps your cat in.\n",
      "\n",
      "My only complaint isn't really a complaint - yes - the fan is noisy, but what fan isn't?\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it's a good buy, and I am considering buying another one so that I don't have to move it from room to room.\n",
      "Update:\n",
      "\n",
      "I initially gave this product an excellent review because it was working fine and doing the job.\n",
      "\n",
      "However,this fan only lasted about a month. Just stopped working for no reason. I kept this running even while it was raining because the motor is suppose to be resistant to water. Not sure if this was the reason why it stopped working, or if the motor just died on its own. I didn't even bother to call the company and just  trashed it. Sure it is possible I received a defective unit, but I would pass on this one.\n",
      "I didn't intend to buy this size, but it was completely my mistake. I wanted the more shallow one, but this actually proved to be a better option. It's solid, and seems like it'll last us for a while.\n",
      "These worked great for my seafood Thanksgiving.  Very nice product.\n",
      "Great product\n",
      "Perfect for dipping and sauces!\n",
      "awsome, especially for the price\n",
      "Grea Product-  Price - and shipping. Very well made!\n",
      "good\n",
      "This had been THE BEST coffee maker I've ever had. Mine is over 10 years old now (and I had gotten it used) so it's time to replace - I'm looking to find the EXACT same one. I've had several in between (well-intentioned gifts) including the kind that grinds itself and brews into a thermal pot (also by Cuisinart), but none of them compared. I LIKE my coffee fresh and while it's still very hot.  I don't like to make a big pot and end up drinking stale or burnt coffee or nuking it to warm it up.  This coffee maker makes it simple enough to quickly brew a fresh pot every time.\n",
      "Perfect for a small guestroom\n",
      "We drink a lot of coffee, so after trying it out at home, this will now mostly be used when travelling:  carrying around a 12-cup coffee maker isn't practical and we really just need a mug apiece while getting up and dressed.  Our motivation was frustration with many hotels switching to Keurigs, which involve a lot of non-recyclable waste and besides, starting the morning with one of us having a cup of coffee while the other one waits is just unsociable.  I looked at several different 4- and 5-cup models, chose this one because it is a bit more compact than the others and since it is for travel, I liked the stainless steel carafe.  A bonus is that we can grind up our own favorite coffee just before leaving and carry it in ziplock freezer bags.  This makes good coffee...not quite sure it is as good as our at-home full-sized Cuisinart and Mr. Coffee, maybe it's the stainless steel carafe or just that it takes experimentation to get the right amount of coffee in each new machine.  In any case on the third try, it is just about as good, maybe as good, and this machine is perfect for our travel needs.\n",
      "So far so good, only thing I would want different is that is was longer until it cut off, good safety feature but rather it be an hour.\n",
      "Great little 4 cup coffee maker. No glass caraffe to break, brew stop for impatient emergency coffee pour before the cycle is finished. Easy to use and clean. Makes very good coffee!\n",
      "I have had this toaster for about 2.5 years.  Over the last few months, two of the slots have started toasting unevenly. One of them has gotten to the point where it toasts the bread properly on one side, but barely toasts the other side at all.  I have to flip the slice of bread in order to get the light side more toasted without burning the other side.  On the plus side, the slots are wide enough for fairly thick bagels, and the toaster stays cool on the outside. It's also easy to clean and doesn't take up as much counter space as my old four-slice toaster did.\n",
      "The toaster looks great.  Unfortunately, it doesn't function as good as it looks, and it's been like this since the day we bought it.  When we toast four slices, two of the slices will be browned on both sides; but the other two slices are only browned on one side.  Using the \"one slice\" slot produces one piece of toast that is only browned on one side; it has to be flipped to get the other side browned.\n",
      "\n",
      "The good thing about the toaster:  the removable trays underneath the unit make it easy to dump the crumbs.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would not recommend this toaster.\n",
      "I bought these to use with my fondue set for the sauces for the price amazing product\n",
      "Cups are perfect size for condiment dipping. Great quality for the price. Shipment arrrived as promised.\n",
      "Great product!  Nice size.  The kids enjoy these for dipping anything and everything in,  They are easy to use and easy to clean. I use them in the kitchen for pre-preping. I also have one in my sewing room to keep the buttons I am using handy.\n",
      "Perfect just what I needed.\n",
      "As expected.\n",
      "Sauce cups! They're sauce cups...... Like at many restaurants.\n",
      "Very convenient to serve condiments on the side without splattering on a plate or in a bowl.  Clean up easily.  Don't allow to sit in water, wash and dry immediately after wetting to preserve durability.\n",
      "I am very happy with this purchase. The item was delivered on perfect condition and as described by the seller. I strongly Reccomended purchasing from them. A+ everything ! Thank you!\n",
      "My husband is a professional chef and he always missed his prep ramekins when cooking at home instead of work.  I bought these and he is so happy!  These are great for holding small ingredients until needed (chopped herbs, garlic, measured spices, etc.), and also as sauce cups for serving.  We made a massive cheese plate for company one night on a large slate, and were able to dress these ramekins up with some detailed washii tape and put the mustard and fruit paste in them- it looked stellar!  I also love that they are dishwasher safe.  If we ever run out of them, since all small things disappear in time, we will repurchase these same ones.\n",
      "These are nice sturdy and attractive metal ramekins.\n",
      "Great little ramicans!\n",
      "I have a lot of outdoor parties and these are perfect for melted butter, dressing, any kind of sauce.\n",
      "I also have used them to put nuts on the side or any item that some of your guests may be allergic to...this way they can decide what/how much to use.\n",
      "Just what I needed.  Works beautifully.\n",
      "I am very pleased with this toaster, one of the best buys for the year.\n",
      "just what I was looking for\n",
      "If you are looking for a product that looks like a restaurant, it suits you very much.  subtle, but because of this, it is suitable for gourmet food.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will report to you in the coming months.\n",
      "These cups are handy and best for condiments.\n",
      "Good for our melted butter for crab - right size for individual use.\n",
      "Did the job\n",
      "Great for condiments and butter for lobster or ketchup for dipping foods!\n",

      "Works as the should\n",
      "Great price, size, well made, multiple used!\n",
      "It works great, it was a good price, but I didn't like the way the lid fits.\n",
      "the worst\n",
      "A bit noisy, but that's fine. Can't fall asleep without the sound of a fan anyway. Not as powerful as I'dve liked. Won't stay in a window with a screen when it's windy. All and all its ok for the price i suppose.\n",
      "The condiment sauce cups are perfect. I like the have a few different sauces (ranch, ketchup, honey mustard) so these a perfect. Also doubles as shot glasses!!\n",
      "-GGers\n",

      "Bought these for sauces ,they are sturdy\n",

      "I used to save plastic containers from fast food joints to put sauces and dressings in for dinner. What a pain. No longer. They feel really, really thin, but they're actually quite sturdy. When I first held them, I was disappointed because I assumed that I could easily crush them with one hand, but I'm happy to report that isn't really the case. They probably wouldn't survive a good stomp.\n",
      "Works as described.\n",
      "Perfect! I got these so that my kids would stop wasting things like ketchup and mustard or what ever they might want to dip their food in. These hold just the right amount and clean up is so easy!\n",
      "These little cups are great and came in handy to melt  things using a double boiler system\n",
      "Great dipping cups\n",
      "Just what I was looking for!\n",
      "Thsee little sauce cups are so cute and modern. Just wash well before using. The first time I washed each there was silver residue on the sponge. Holds plenty of sauce for any meal.\n",
      "Ordered them once and LOVED them, so I ordered them again. They are different sizes. Just enough so they don't nest properly. So, don't expect a standard size.\n",
      "Use for Chile or ketchup or salad dressing on the side even the grandkids don't use too much ranch dressing now. Nice and heavy metal too.\n",
      "- No label to indicate which way to orient the fan or intake or exhaust.\n",
      "- Air movement can only blow a paper napkin from about a foot away.\n",
      "Ok, there is only one reason to buy this, and that's because it's smaller than most of these types of window fans. It fits in my 11\" opening window, and it moves air. If you have a normal window, get something else. If you don't like rattling noises, get something else. If I were to do it again, I'd get one or two of these types of small clip on fans (https://www.amazon.com/Comfort-Zone-CZ6C-Clip-White/dp/B000U9V47E), because the Lasko ones I got a while back are nice an quiet and I have a screen. But if you can't make any other option work, this is a fan and it will blow air around.\n",
      "as expected\n",
      "Very nice well made and so far no problems with them.\n",
      "These are not as heavy or sturdy as I had hoped or expected. In my humble opinion it seems likely they are polished aluminum and not stainless steel.\n",
      "As advertised !!!!!!!\n",
      "This is a basic fan that has worked well for the past month. You place it in the window, extend the side panels, plug in the power and turn it on.  It's manually reversible which means you physically turn it around if you want it to blow out instead of blowing in, and there is an on/off switch on both sides.  You can pay more for more features, but this seems to do the job. Oh, yes, it does make noise but I don't notice it too much. It's not more noise than a window air conditioner.  In general with window fans, you have windows open in two different rooms so put it in the other room if it's too loud for you.\n",
      "Purchase one for less than $20 at your local walmart or online. This is junk. Where do I begin? First the seller has a 1 item per household quantity limit. Fine. But it's not even worth it. I had my mom order me another and it was broken right out the box (see pic). This is horribly loud. Second it's cheap and flimsy. I found a nice one at the store that was so much better and quiet. I like the hum of a fan but not random loud vibration rumbles. Sounds like it's about to blast off. They also do not put this into an additional shipping box. They just slap all your info on it & send it out. I don't like that because stuff gets broken that way. I ordered a $50 one off amazon that was packaged perfectly in a separate box. Only pro is this fan does the job and has a manual switch on both sides for either in or out. Otherwise junk. Ya get what you pay for in this case. I'm returning.\n",
      "does the job\n",
      "Not as sturdy as I had hoped. But, they will work.\n",
      "Great little condiment cups with so many uses.  Very sturdy.  I'm thinking of getting another set.\n",
      "Useful for many purposes and also to measure doses of liquids.\n",
      "As stated\n",
      "very useful great quality product\n",
      "Worked to keep my demolition project upstairs some what cool, vibrates like mad, but moves the air. Did the job\n",
      "Little larger than I thought but works great\n",
      "Love these for dipping sauces. Cuts down waste!\n",
      "These are perfect for controlling portion sizes in dressings and other condiments.\n",
      "ok\n",
      "Very good product. Each individually wrapped. Perfect size for making recipes for 1-2 people. My son, the chef, needed these and gets full use of them in preparing his excellent food for me and him. Easier than using plates or bowls. Cleanup in dishwasher is easy.\n",
      "I bought these for my pet mice.  They chew holes in all non metal or glass dishes.  These were a great price and perfect tiny size for a handful of mice.\n",
      "Same quality as I had previously bought in a restaurant supply.\n",
      "Perfect for condiments or melted butter for crab.\n",
      "Not great quality and there is no way these were ever $50 fans. You get exactly what you pay for.\n",
      "This is an obligatory comment so they can stop asking how great this product is.\n",
      "Very good,just what I want\n",
      "i love this!\n",
      "This does the fan thing but it sounds like a train. Very noisy\n",
      "I use these for cooking... I measure out all of my ingredients before beginning and these are the perfect size for spices, garlic, oil, lemon juice, etc.  They are small enough where I can stack all twelve and still close my utensil drawer.\n",
      "good\n",
      "Got these today.  Because of the price on this product, I feel that I got what I paid for.  Let me just say a couple of things that might help you decide whether or not to spend your money...\n",
      "\n",
      "Nowhere on this product is it stamped STAINLESS STEEL.  Because I am not sure that is a requirement by law, I will not dispute their descriptions, stating is is, in fact, stainless.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, the metal is so thin, I am not sure  they will stay seated on a plate without flying right off. Again, I am thinking about the low price on this item and  trying to not be too critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "That being said, I will just tell you that: I would not buy this product again. And, I am not sure I would really ever use this item on a plate, while serving anyone I cared about. I see a mess in somebody's lap.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom Line: Save your money.\n",
      "it was brand new, came within time frame specified,  highly recommend\n",
      "I'm keeping it, but...  It has little legs that it can optionally use to stand on.  The rubber pieces on these legs fall off continuously.  Even though I noticed this, I lost one withing one minute.  The unit is a bright, fluorescent white, not the typical off-white of my other fans.  It does not blend well with egg-shell paint tone.\n",
      "Otherwise - it was the narrowest double fan I could find on amazon and the only one that would fit my small window area.  It is about as loud as all my other fans of the same size - normal fan volume.\n",
      "This fan was inexpensive so I will say that I am receiving what I paid for. I have it in the window to my kitchenette and it does bring in fresh air or exhaust the smoke and heat from cooking.when reversed. Somewhat inconvenient to reverse as it has to be manually turned around but it is easy to do. I will say that it does the job but not anything more. :-)\n",
      "Fan is a bit noisy, and the air output is low. However, on low breeze days, it does pull some cool air into a 10' x 14' x 8'H room. Unfortunately, that air doesn't travel very far from the window; therefore, I need a second small fan to circulate the air about the room. My setup is: One Optimus at the top of the window (exhaust) , another at bottom (Intake) with a small circular fan in front of it. The room is much cooler, but I had to be creative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, you'll have to find a way to keep the insects out.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, I ran these fans on high almost 24/7 during the entire spring season and they are still working\n",
      "These are very useful for a number of things.  I primarily use them for individual servings of dipping sauces for seafood and such.  They're good quality and are dishwasher safe.  I'm pleased with my purchase.\n",
      "great for butter or small amounts of dip,...good price!\n",
      "Simple product, but well made.  I have had others like this where the rim was too weak and the cup would flex and crack.  These have a nice strong rim.  They do the job.\n",
      "Great price, great cups!!\n",
      "Very well made, 12 per package, much better price that the \"cooking store\" price of $2 each(2x12=$24).\n",
      "Another review of a similar product said they were weak and flimsy.\n",
      "These cups are \"restaurant quality\" will last many years...........\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazon Prime to the door and everything is great......!!\n",
      "I love using these for prepping my herbs and spices. Nice quality, fantastic price. They don't take up a lot of space, and they are also dishwasher safe. I think they're terrific.\n",
      "Great for serving dipping sauces, or for pre-measuring ingredients when cooking or backing.  Very satisfied.\n",
      "I wasn't happy with this fan it vibrates way too much to ever be quiet enough for my needs there was no securing it to stop the vibration noise.\n",
      "switch broke within 2 weeks.  Very disappointed in the quality of the switch.  Fan was powerful while it was working.\n",
      "Ok, its not a 15,000 btu air mover, but it works as advertised. Quiet to noisy, depending on fan setting. The expandable skirts work well in the window tracks. Drop the window down on top and you have a pretty sealed unit. Now for the money, you get what you pay for. So, I got what I paid for and am happy. Recommended.\n",
      "I am not terribly pleased with this fan, as you may have guessed from the two-star review.\n",
      "\n",
      "I bought this product because I am a smoker, and I live on the tenth floor of my building, which can make going outside for a cigarette a pain in the butt. A bigger pain in the butt is a smokey and smelly apartment. I thought buying a window fan could make smoking indoors better by properly ventilating the smoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this fan doesn't seem to do much. I can smoke right next to it, and I often notice that the smoke moves in the opposite direction than the fan is blowing. I have no explanation for it. Maybe the seal around the window isn't tight enough. Who knows? But the smoke just does not go out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the fan gets super shaky and loud sometimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd recommend spending a few more dollars on a better fan if you're seeking proper ventilation.\n",
      "This is a very poorly made product. The blades are not very powerful and the construction material is cheap. I had bought it to use at night in the summer to keep my house and room cool without having to resort to using the AC. When I used it, the entire unit vibrated and I ended up have to turn it off because I was scared it would fall off the window still. I would recommend buying a different brand.\n",
      "fits the window perfectly.  Works great. Got it very quickly. It is very quiet when on.  It cools down a room very quickly!\n",
      "I thought the blades were going to be 7\" but as it turns out they are only about 6\". Other than that, it's fine.\n",
      "these are fabulous well made cups not  flimsy. the edge is rolled and not sharp as  some poor ratings a year ago described.\n",
      "i am getting into indian cooking and these are perfect sizes to put out various spices  before i  go using a shaker.\n",
      "these are also used by my kitties when they want a jigger of rum\n",
      "Would you believe that I use these to hold nuts, screws, and bolts when disassembling an appliance? You can keep the parts separate from different places on the appliance.\n",
      "The downside to these is that they rusted slightly after the first use.  The spots where the bottom is joined to the side as well as under the rim don't seem to be completely sealed, so water on these spots resulted in rust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other than that, which can be cleaned, these have nice weight and are a nice, small size.\n",
      "great value, doesn't stain, very durable, and stylish\n",
      "The perfect size for \"personal portions\" of ketchup or other sauces to go on the plate for dipping.  I find them also useful for mise en place containers.  They come out of the dishwasher sparkling!  And all of this at an amazing price.  How great is that?\n",
      "I paid a little more than 3 bucks for a dozen similar stainless steel sauce cups (with rolled edges) from TheWebstaurantStore. I've been using them for over a year now, to measure out small amounts of spices and herbs so I can line up everything I need for a recipe.\n",
      "\n",
      "These days, with my memory going, it's the best way to stop myself adding spices twice. Or three times. Or more. Plus, it's just a lot handier. Now I can cook a lot faster - just measure everything out before, line them up in the order I'll need them, then I can just glance at the recipe clipped over the counter, grab the next cup, and just whip through the cooking process.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have some small glass bowls in two sizes for larger amounts as well that I got from a dollar store - the smallest ones come 4 to a pack (for a dollar) and the next size up comes 3 to a pack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having these ingredient bowls in the various sizes really helped me to be able to continue cooking, in less time, with less energy, and with a LOT less confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "These little cups come in a 1.5 oz size, which is what I have, suitable for a couple T of spices or what have you, and a larger 2.5 oz size.\n",
      "\n",
      "They've really been very very handy in the kitchen!\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "1. Provide decent airflow\n",
      "2. Relatively light-weight\n",
      "3. Adjustable side blocker\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "1. Quite loud. Personally unlikely to use it during sleeptime\n",
      "2. Uni-directional for both fans.\n",
      "3. It seems its fans speed would fluctuate when there is natural wind blowing through it.\n",
      "This product does not have a lot of features. But it is simple in design, fits windows perfectly, and is inexpensive.  This is a much better design than the popular Holms fans.  Works great!  Love it!\n",
      "Use them for my grand children to put syrup, ketcup, ranch dressing etc, They work great and easy to clean up.\n",
      "use them every day for dipping pretzels and celery\n",
      "Great for sauces\n",
      "great! i use them for mise en place  (sp?)  - anyhow, for putting small quantities of ingredients out for cooking.  they're good quality and work perfectly.\n",
      "as expected\n",
      "nice condiment cups- used the for butter sauce for lobster and had no issues.  nice to use with company\n",
      "We bought this Cuisinart coffeemaker to replace an eight cup coffeemaker that did not brew enough for our family's needs.  We like the thermal carafe that keeps the coffee very hot for more than two hours.  We also like the fact that the coffee cannot burn.  It is easy to fill and brew coffee and it is easy to program the machine for later brewing.  Cleaning is easy and the coffeemaker is a good height under cabinets.\n",
      "  The only slightly off thing is the use of 'cone' shaped filters and that the carafe feels a bit lightweight and 'tinny'.\n",
      "  We are enjoying this coffeemaker very much.\n",
      "Like another reviewer's, my coffee maker stopped functioning after four months of use ... one month out of the warranty period.  I liked it up till then!  I called customer service and was given instructions to delime it ... of course we do that all the time and it was not the problem.  I called back and was told too bad, it is out of warranty, no repair or other customer satisfaction option available, but I was offered to purchase a new one from their website and then I'd have a 3 year warranty.  I then wrote customer service and expressed my disappointment that their refurbished product lasted only four months before catastrophic failure, with a request for options for repair, and was sent a response that they offer no service or other compensation for their refurb products.  Shame on Cuisinart for providing a refurbished product that cannot live up to even a year's basic use as intended!  I would not buy this again refurb; maybe new with the expectation of having to use the warranty.  The best I can say for it is that the thermal carafe is superior to other carafe systems I've used.\n",
      "What am I missing?  reconditioned for $191 or brand new for $99??????  Are these people crooks?\n",
      "I've had this coffee maker for about five years of flawless service, making at least one pot a day, seven days a week, etc.  I have never had a problem screwing on the lid and I've never had a problem closing the filter basket.  By-the-way, those who complain about the lid being difficult to unscrew to the \"pour position\" and that the coffee then doesn't stay hot are nuts.  There is no pour position.  The lid stays in place during the brewing cycle and during pouring afterward.  It self seals.  If you are unscrewing the lid, for some insane reason, you are needlessly breaking the seal, which is why your coffee is getting cold.  Mine stays hot for easily five hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "And for those who have \"the 10 cup version\" and try to piggy back whatever problems they've had with it onto this unit, I would just say that this coffee maker DOES NOT HAVE a 10 cup version.  While Cuisinart makes a 10 cup thermal carafe coffee maker, it is an entirely different design.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, in the last week or so, after all these years, my wonderful coffee maker has developed a leak.  A drip, actually, during the brew cycle, from behind the filter basket.  I think maybe a seal may have broken.  Very tight area with poor visibility.  But, not to worry!  When I bought this unit I liked it so much I bought a backup, figuring the time would come to replace it and it wouldn't be available.  So I just pulled the box out of the hall closet, opened it up and plugged in my brand new coffee maker.  The only difference is I've gone from black to white.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am pleasantly surprised to find this machine still on the market.  I cannot recommend it strongly enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I bought both of mine, back then, remanufactured, for $39.95 each - shipping included.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah.....those were the days.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ciao!\n",
      "Sauce cups. Made of metal. They haven't rusted as of yet, what more could I ask for?\n",
      "These are great for dips, ketchup or butter for lobsters.  You really can't beat the price....they clean up great.\n",
      "These things are really great and perfect for dinner parties or everyday dining. People are amazed when they see these things they think that they are at a fancy restaurant. They look good, do not leak and are dishwasher safe.\n",
      "Just what I needed. Great for sauces etc for meals or spices when cooking.\n",
      "Perfect size, exactly what I wanted.\n",
      "We use them all the time for dips, sauces, etc.\n",
      "No one should be expecting too much for the price. I think the fan works great. Pushes air just fine, clears a smokey room in no time. Held up to the rain, still running fine.\n",
      "I do greatly enjoy this fan.  It works very well, and the knob is on both sides so it can be used for exhaust also.\n",
      "pretty powerful, easily fits the window. Hopefully, it would also last longer than the 6 mos my other fan did\n",
      "We bought this fan to cool down our room at night in the summer. It works exactly as I hoped it would. This fan has a nice feature that it can be operated from either side, making it reversible and allowing you to blow air in or out. This fan is a fairly small unit, but it does a great job moving air. I'm able to angle it in the window opening so that it blows on our bed, and it does just as well as an AC unit would without the high electricity cost. It also comes with detachable feet to allow to be freestanding if needed. There are accordion sides that allow it to adapt to most any window openings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this is just what we needed. It gets a little dirty, but other reviews seemed to say it can be cleaned with compressed air. However, I'm not yet at a point in my life where I have the luxury of worrying about dirty fan blades. Some day...\n",
      "\n",
      "Hope this helped! Let me know if you have any questions!\n",
      "did noy rec.\n",
      "Great dipping cups\n",
      "smaller than I thought\n",
      "These are nice though I'd rather have gone for the next size up in retrospect.  They're nice though and probably better for dipping larger food items that wouldn't fit into deeper cups.  Also would be good as mixing cups for things like epoxy resin since residue could be allowed to dry and then chipped out.  Currently I use plastic disposable cups for mixing resin but I might set a couple of these aside for this purpose as the added weight would make it easier to dip applicator brushes in to, one handed, without it sliding around.  Primarily though I bought these for food and am happy with my purchase.\n",
      "Just what I ordered. I did think they would have been a bit larger. I am happy with them though.\n",
      "I bought this coffee maker because I was tired of transferring coffee into a thermal pumper after brewing with our old coffee maker.  In addition, our coffee never stayed hot for any period of time before.  But now, with the new Cuisinart thermal coffee maker, our coffee is hot for a very long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't have the problems some of the other reviewers have mentioned, although I am very careful to click the basket closed and to maneuver the carafe lid to the proper position.  It is easy to use and brews great coffee quickly.  The \"beep\" at the end of the brewing cycle is nice, plus it turns itself off when it is done, too.  This is a great feature, I think.  It is easy to see how much water to put in, too.  There is a little thermometer-like window on the side that has a small red ball in it and it goes up to the level you want when you pour water in.\n",
      "\n",
      "We just love this coffee maker and I would recommend it to anyone.  We paid only $89 on sale, which I consider a bargain.  It is very tall, so if you have a small space for a coffee maker, you might want to measure before you buy.\n",
      "We bought this so the guests at our B & B could take their coffee outside to the view deck. We use very fine espresso grind and that can be a problem.  The water doesn't go through the coffee fast enough and overflows.  However, if I use a coarser grind, it works fine.  The other solution is to brew in my other Cuisinart coffee maker and pour that batch into the Thermal Coffeemaker...then the coffee stays hot and the outside of the Thermal Coffeemaker is not hot and can be carried outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "Betty, Casa Montaa Bed & Breakfast, Redstone, Colorado\n",
      "This coffeemaker is quiet, fast, nice looking, and easy to use.  I have encountered no problems with closing the basket, as described by others.  And yes, the coffee does stay warm in the carafe for hours.  The carafe itself is easily worth the cost of the product.  Shipping was fast and item was securely packaged and arrived in perfect condition - not a single indication that it was \"remanufactured.\"  All programming functions work as described, and programming the unit takes seconds.  Instruction manual clear, easy to understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only oddity is the slow rate of pouring through the top of the carafe, still haven't figured this one out and will keep trying.  When pouring coffee, one wants to get the cup filled quickly, but the top of my carafe prevents this from happening, and the coffee kind of dribbles out so slowly that filling the cup takes 3X as long as it should.  Other than that, fabulous!\n",
      "These are functional and nice looking.  We use them for condiments and passing out medications (we have many in our household).  Keeps the pills in line, so to speak.  Holds just the right amount of ketchup or mayo.  I wash them by hand, by the way.\n",
      "These condiment cups are exactly as described.  They are just the right size for what I needed.\n",
      "The packaging isn't fancy at all, individual plastic bags stuffed in a small corrugated cardboard box... but then I wasn't giving them away as a gift so who cares what the box looks like?\n",
      "Doesnt break, easy to clean and very reliable.  Used it for pills for residents and it looks very clean and professional.\n",
      "Used these in a house on Molokai and liked them.  Ordered my own set when I returned home. Arrived on time and in good condition.\n",
      "These a very good quality, heavy cups.  They heat well for melting small amounts of ingredients, and do not discolor or stain.\n",
      "These are exactly as expected.  Perfect size for home dining!  We love them on junk food night!  Thank you tons!\n",
      "These are even better than I was hoping for. Very good quality! Useful for many things - hard to find this tiny size.\n",
      "I am a dipper.  I like to have a variety of dips for almost anything I eat. These are great for having multiple dippings at one time.  Small enough to not take up to much table room, but big enough to have plenty of sauce in each one.\n",
      "Perfect for restaurant style serving at home, and have a great look with our stainless flatware and modern look. Great amount and last long with dishwashing.\n",
      "I wanted little cups into which I could put cocktail sauce, mustard for sausages, et cetera. These are perfect, fitting the bill exactly, are solid metal- can imagine I will have for years to come.\n",
      "These are great for seafood or even just for condiments!  Stack nicely and don't take up much space.  Highly recommend!\n",
      "Love this for my spicy dressings or dipping sauce. Cant beat the price. Good quantity to work with. There just big enuff for dipping some fries.\n",
      "These cups are the perfect dipping size.  Two of the twelve that I received had some rust on them which leads me to believe that I have to be careful washing them. They look great on plates. Great for entertaining.\n",
      "My parents are big coffee drinkers and I wanted to make sure they got their coffee in the morning when they were visiting. I picked up the refurb DTC-975 when it was on sale. The unit that arrived was actully the newer model with the stainless steel filter basket above. It looked great with minimal indications it wasn't brand-spanking new. (Surface marks, etc.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only did this unit make a great cup of coffee; the carafe kept the coffee hot and fresh all morning. Very happy with the purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE: I just added a photo of the coffee maker to the customer images. Enjoy!\n",
      "Well, maybe not cheerfully, but I'd know I was getting my money's worth. The only criticism I have is that the clock display should be a bit more readable for old f*rts like me, and the auto-on confirmation should be an LED rather than the teeny-tiny \"AUTO\" on the clock display.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, the thermal carafe is outstanding. I'd been surprised that leftover coffee seemed still warm when dumping it out late in the evening after a morning brew; the other night I had my barbecue thermometer in my shirt pocket, so I checked the temperature -- 120 degrees, fourteen hours after brewing.\n",
      "\n",
      "J have since discovered that there is a weight-triggered heating element in the base which gently warms the bottom of the carafe. It's not hot enough to spoil the taste of the coffee even after several hours.\n",
      "I use these ramekins for weighing hops and other specialty ingredients for home-brewing.  They're light, they're a good size, and they haven't rusted after repeated use.  I also like to have a few beers while making beer, so I've accidentally left these guys out in the elements more than a few times.  Even after that kind of blatant abuse, they've resisted oxidation.  Great purchase for any home brewer.\n",
      "These are perfect for what I need them for! It makes using recipes easy when you can measure everything out ahead of time, and just add it in. I also wanted some sauce cups so these do double duty for me which is a plus. They do make some with a wider opening that may be more appropriate for sauces, but I didn't get them. I think these seem a little more traditional for use in the kitchen. Overall, great quality. Bought 24 of them!\n",
      "I absolutely love these. They are a great size for \"dipping sauces\" and we use them for one thing or another almost daily. Very happy with them!\n",
      "At first I was annoyed that there were so many in this set because I thought I only needed a few for my toddler (we use metal dishes for him) but it turns out we use them all the time. Sometimes he'll just use one but other times I'll set out a few with an assortment of food.\n",
      "I use these little cups pretty much every day.  They're perfect for dipping sauces of course, but also for things like a single serving of peanut butter, to hold a little bit of salt to sprinkle on each bite of a soft boiled egg, and they're the perfect size to hold the tea infuser ball I use.  Depending on the type of tea, I'll sometimes put the tea ball in one of these cups and then stick it in the fridge so I can use it again for another cup of tea a few hours later.  Also good for just holding the tea ball after the mug of tea has finished brewing.  My husband has one designated cup that he uses for weighing lye when he makes soap, and I've used the cups to hold tiny beads.  All around very handy!  Uses aside, the quality of these is nice.  They seem pretty sturdy to me, with nicely rolled under edges.  I squeezed one as hard as I could and the cup did not get any dents or anything.  They're also nice and stable, and of course they take up barely any space in the cabinet.  We've owned these cups for about a year now and they still look new, but they're always hand washed since we don't have a dishwasher.\n",
      "These are not great. In fact, I returned them, because they are not stainless steel. I tried to wash them before using and some of the \"stainless like\" coating came off. I do not find that safe at all. I do not recommend.\n",
      "UPDATE 03/26/2010:  Coffee maker just pooped out on me after less then three years.  Why?  Heck if I know...\n",
      "\n",
      "I have had this coffeemaker for five years and have been very happy with the product.  It unexpectedly gave out on me the day after I had turned it over to wipe down the underside with a damp cloth.  I'm not sure if moisture got in to the circuitry and shorted the heating element/control when wiped, if moisture was already inside and tipping it over caused a problem, or if it just wore out.  I really liked the insulated carafe and simplicity of design and operation.  When I saw that Amazon sells a refurbished model for 1/3 the cost of a new one it was too good of an opportunity to pass especially with Amazon's great return policy.  I received the coffeemaker and it looks absolutely brand new.  Not a scratch or blemish on either the maker or carafe.  Comes in a white box labeled refurbished.  The package includes a set of instructions and a few filters.  There is a sticker on the box that indicates the manufacturers warranty for a refurbished Cuisinary is only 90 days.  A new one has a 2 year warranty.  The model I received is not the one pictured.  I received what looks like the 975BKN which basically has more stainless steel on the filter housing.  I also noticed a significant difference from the maker that I had gotten 5 years ago.  My original insulated carafe was made with the mirrored glass inside making it like a thermos.  The carafe I just received is just two layers of stainless steel similar to a travel mug.  The thermos carafe is definitely superior in keeping the coffee hot for a longer time.  The thermos carafe only holds 10 cups while the new carafe holds 12 cups due to its thinner walls.\n",
      "Four stars because my last one gave up the ghost without cause and the new and un-improved carafe.\n",
      "I have owned this unit now for about six months, having received it as a gift for X-mas.  I would like to give it 4.5 stars, because of the design flaws noted in other reviews, but due to its simplicity and ease of use I can forgive this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "Thermal carafe keeps coffee warm longer\n",
      "Easy to load basket and it's washable\n",
      "12 cup capacity means I have coffee in the carafe for two days (and it's usually still warm the next day!)\n",
      "Easily programmable and simple to use\n",
      "Carafe is well balanced and easy to pour\n",
      "The swing out basket makes adding grounds from my grinder a breeze\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "Must be VERY cautious that the basket is properly seated otherwise spillage is a certainty\n",
      "Cleaning the carafe is somewhat problematic (though a mixture of warm bleach and water left to sit a while will usually do the trick)\n",
      "I could see the beeping being annoying but it doesn't bother me\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I recommend this unit, with the caveat that you be CERTAIN to adequately seat the basket or there will be coffee on the floor and none in your mug (this happened one morning to me at 630 am, not a good time for mopping up cups of spilled coffee).  The basket design is problematic on my model, but everything else works like a champ.  Perhaps in the future they can have it click into place or something to indicate that it won't stab you in the back - et tu Cuisinart?\n",
      "This is a great buy for sure.  It comes in handy for my Kitchen lab class, as i need small cup like items to portion out my ingredients for menu items.  Plus for the sauces i can present them in these now vs small bowls.  These are perfect in size and great for all kitchen uses.\n",
      "Received with some having scratches and with black marks. Three of them rusted after their first wash. Poor Quality. Returned.\n",
      "Cool little stainless sauce cups!  More heavy-duty and less prone to breaking than the plastic types.  I use these for measuring out my hop pellets when doing homebrew.  One cup holds about 1 oz of pellets perfectly (though I use a scale to perform the measurement).\n",
      "Like other reviewers two arrived that were cracked.  Too much trouble to return, the others are ok.  They are very lightweight.\n",
      "Not using these for sauces but they are great for keeping very small craft items in one place.  They are sturdy metal and do not tip easily.\n",
      "This is my second remanufactured Cuisinart coffeemaker from Amazon; my first was the manual 10-cup thermal, which I wore out after many years.\n",
      "\n",
      "This coffeemaker is a dream to use & maintain, and makes a great cup of coffee. \"Remanufactured\" means minor scuffs on some of the plastic parts, which were hardly noticeable. Considering that I just saw this unit at the store for $139.99, I'd say that this is a \"must-buy\" item!\n",
      "works great only negative comment is it pours a little slow. Other then that I love it. Stainless carafe  keeps the coffee hot for a long time.  Glass pots are fragile and costly to replace not a problem with this one. looka nice too\n",
      "This is the perfect coffee maker to have at your desk, except for the high-pitched alarm which sounds after the brewing cycle is complete. The 12-cup thermal carafe keeps coffee hot for up to eight hours, and the last cup tastes as fresh as the first.  No vices apparent after a month-plus of frequent use. I don't know if I'd have paid full retail for this, but since I got a great deal on a remanufactured one, I'm a happy, caffeinated camper!\n",
      "I see the one star review.  Sorry pal...YOUR FAULT!\n",
      "\n",
      "The pot has the feature of allowing the user to take a cup before the cycle completes.  A spring loaded lever blocks the outlet when this is done.  If you don't insert the pot properly, the outlet remains blocked and the water overruns the top sending grounds and water all over.  If you are prone to that or don't need the feature, you can easily remove this lever.  I have done that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cuisinart makes the best coffee that I have encountered.  One thing I do that is unusual is set the brew to the middle range of cups.  In my 12 cup pot, that is around 6-8.  This causes the pot to send the hot water slightly slower and brews a stronger coffee.  I like a strong cup and the normal measure plus one for the pot is only strong enough when I do that.\n",
      "If you have some butter at a party and you want to impress, contain them in these dishes. Your guests will really flip out. \"Butter! In a cup!?\" They can't believe how great you are.\n",
      "Just what I was looking for ... perfect portion size\n",
      "I don't have anything else to say but more verbage is required\n",
      "I ran these ramekins through the dishwasher (top rack) when I received them before using and two of them are already showing rust on the bottom.\n",
      "Be careful closing the grind basket.  Have had several overflows of coffee on our counter.  Basket must be CLICKED into place.  A couple of times it seemed closed but wasn't.  You must hear the click. Found it easier\n",
      "to do so with the water container lid open.\n",
      "Difficult to turn the coffee pot lid to pour, where it must be when the coffee is made.  It stays on when the\n",
      "coffee is poured with no problem. Coffee nice and hot when made, which we wanted, but doesn't stay hot as long as we like.\n",
      "I had this coffeemaker for several months and loved it.  Apparently, it is the ONLY 12-cup maker with a thermal caraffe.  Then, one morning, it just didn't work any more.  Of course I no longer have the sales receipt or packaging and...oh yeah...I'm jonesing for my coffee.  I trashed it and bought a cheapie at WalMart to make it through the day.  It makes me nervous about spending another $100 on a maker that lasts a few months.  Could have been a fluke, but how would I know?\n",
      "Bought this to suck air out of a enclosed patio.  Fit ok to the window, had to use tape to seal it off so bugs/water would not get in.  Only real problem was if the wind outside was strong, it would stop the fan and blow back into the room.  Other than that it worked pretty well.\n",
      "There's a smoker in the house so instead of her going outdoors in the winter I installed this in the den. It does such a good job you wouldn't know there was a smoker\n",
      "I purchased this fan to use for \"white noise\" when I sleep. I couldn't have made a better purchase! It is LOUD. For me, this is a selling feature. It has a very powerful fan that kicks air out with force. IF you do not want the noise, do not order this little guy. But for those of us who use them for white noise, the included feet ensure it stands up right on carpet, and the reversible \"exhaust fan\" feature allows you to keep the heavy output to the wall, so as not to freeze you out of your room in winter. I'm very pleased.\n",
      "even though i am a smoker, i hate when smoke lingers in the house. this fan can be used as an exhaust as well and fits perfectly in the window. now we turn it on every time we smoke and it makes a world of a difference. a great deal for the price.\n",
      "These are great for any kitchen. They are just the right size for any sauce or condiment, you will find yourself using them at every meal.  Very durable and easy to clean.\n",
      "How can you really go wrong with these. Only thing I wish is that they came with lids for storing unused condiments in the fridge.\n",
      "Exactly what I was looking for. I have needed something to serve aux juis in fore years. A quick search on Amazon and now I have a dozen. Perfect\n",
      "Good quality and fair price with great value. These ramekins are very useful with a simple design and clean lines.\n",
      "I use them for baking to put all the small ingreadiances in and we use them as intended great size\n",
      "These are nice little stainless steel cups. Great for putting your condiments in.  They are perfect if you have a restaurant.  I bought them for use around the house so a dozen is excessive but I put half in the kitchen and half in my tool room.  I like to use them for some jobs when I need a little bit of rubbing alcohol, paint thinner, glues, etc.\n",
      "Just what I needed. Multiple sauce cups for culinary school. Lightweight and they are easy to carry in my bag.\n",
      "I bought these to use with a cheese tray I was putting together for a party.  They are great for sauces and dips and the price is right.  I can see using them a lot and for many different kitchen/serving applications over the years.\n",
      "I really wasn't sure what I would use these for but for the reasonable price I decided to buy them. We use them to serve salsas and relishes with meals. We like to use them for serving condiments and salad dressing when serving the kids to prevent waste. The 21/2 ounce size measures 2 1/8 inches across the top and 1 1/2 inches tall.  They are also stack-able, so the whole stack is under 3 inches high.\n",
      "I ordered these for mise en place and also for use as spacers in the top of my mason jars of lacto-fermented pickles and saurkraut. Works great in both capacities. I find myself using them a lot for their original purpose too, as a sauce/dressing/dipping container, because they're the perfect capacity for a single serving. They're sturdy and easy to clean, even though I find myself washing them by hand most of the time because they are small enough to fall through the rack in my dishwasher.\n",
      "Bought these because I make bread and wanted something small to put the ingredients in before adding to the breadmaker.  These are wonderful!!!  Just the right size!  My counter space is limited and these take up little room.  They are also the right size for a small snack.  They are light-weight but a medium heaviness to the steel.  These little cups will last forever!\n",
      "I'm glad I checked out Wal-Mart first. Four for $.88 at Wal-mart, 2 oz each. They will do just fine. I needed them for horseradish sauce.\n",
      "I bought these for mise en place of small measures of ingredients, and they have served me well.  I always have at least six of them in my catering toolbox.\n",
      "Bought these to hold butter dipping sauce for lobster tails for our Christmas dinner.  Work great.  Also, I like that they're stackable b/c they hardly take up any room in the cupboard.\n",
      "Lovely little cups and very well made.  Can also use to put condiments when making chili or other dishes that require a lot of spices.\n",
      "I bought this new and so paid even more.  I liked the design with its insert that can be flipped over to serve as a steamer as I steam seafood and vegetables.  It accomplishes this and it does cook rice adequately, though it does seem to get a bit messier than imagined.  I liked the stainless look but would rate it as adequate. I do like the retractable cord but do not like that the low heat begins as soon as it is plugged in.  After taking the rice out I have forgotten to unplug it and it can toast anything still in the pot inadvertently. Why no \"off\" setting?\n",
      "I bought a different style pasta pot by Tramontina at least seven years ago.  I don't know if it is still available.  I think it has held up quite well to relatively heavy use.  My pot is a sauce pan style with a locking lid.  There is a little wear to the nonstick coating up near the top, possibly from the cover or stacking with other pots.  I would buy other products from this company.\n",
      "Used the pot and couldn't get the top off. Got the top off by prying the ears back and damaging the coating. The ears that hold the pot down are too big for the grooves on the pot itself.\n",
      "When I moved, my pasta cooker got left behind.  This is one kitchen must have for me!  It's so much easier than having to deal with a pot and colander.  Plus the fact the pasta stays hot.  This cooker is also great for making sugar syrup, fudge, etc.\n",
      "The pot functions as it should, but the quality of the product is not as high as it should be for the price. The colander top works well and saves a step in draining pasta.\n",
      "This pasta cooker was built on a good idea, but once you have taken out the water is impossible to take the lid off! The only way I can do it is sliding off to either side, but this scratches the pot...I think you would be good looking somewhere else.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would not recommend this product.\n",
      "I love this pot! I bought it at a thrift store two years ago, used, and while it has some damage, it still works perfectly for me. I love the locking lid. We gave away a new pot rather than retire this one; I'm very happy to see a chance to buy it online.\n",
      "There are a variety of sizes for this same pot, they list it in inches rather than how many ounces or milliliters they hold.  It appears to hold between 5 and 6 ounces.  I just wasn't sure which one to buy.  This works well so I'm happy.  The cap is not stainless steel.  It is plastic with a silver coating.  I wash the bottom glass part in the dishwasher, but handwash the cap (avoid the paint flaking that happens in time).  No drips and an even pour.\n",
      "It works perfectly. It was a little smaller than I had hoped, but the other features make up for that. The temperature control actually does what it says (unlike so many other waffle makers!), and the 2.5 minutes is as fast as you can ask for. It didn't hurt my feelings that you can store it upright to save cupboard space either.\n",
      "Even nicer than shown, quality weight of both parts, the spout is very small in diameter giving perfect ability to apply only amount you wish. Lovely addition to table for dining.\n",
      "nice for the kitchen\n",
      "Excellent product, funtions well and it's beautiful.\n",
      "Flow is a lot more than what you might get at a restaurant.  You have to be careful or it will come out very quickly and you'll get a lot more than you planned.\n",
      "This was a replacement for an exact one like this when we got married nine years ago. It had finally broken but even then the only part that had broken was the part to lift the lid. The knob to adjust the temp doesn't seem to really do anything and it had come over years before but we never had a problem with it even after it came off.\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "1. Works well.\n",
      "2. Non-stick surface is effective and seems durable.\n",
      "3. Well balanced; isn't inclined to tip.\n",
      "4. Easy to open without getting burned by escaping steam or by accidentally touching the hot metal surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "1. Sometimes it cooks a little unevenly where the heating element is.  Not enough to be a problem though.\n",
      "2. On mine the cord was about a half inch too short to reach the storage holes.  I took the bottom off and loosened the cord restraint enough to reposition the cord.  It was easy to retighten the restraint and reassemble just like new.  Now it's perfect.\n",
      "temp adjuster is a bit chintzy feeling but its a \"cooker\" all right, so far so good\n",
      "Works well and easy to keep clean.\n",
      "Plain, simple and it works well.\n",
      "The same model they use at P.F. Chang's, for those who are curious. Great pour rate, my wife thinks it is cute.\n",
      "I usually bought a large bottle of Kikkoman soy sauce and transferred a smaller amount to a used Kikkoman dispenser. After using this method for a number of years, I got tired of all the dripping.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the Asvel soy sauce dispenser. It works and looks great. Most importantly, the leakage has stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bottle is well designed and made of glass. Describing the bottle as having a \"stainless steel cap\" is misleading. It is a plastic cap with a stainless steel wrapper.\n",
      "This does the job, but the soy sauce clogs the spout between pourings.\n",
      "This is a perfect soy sauce pot. Since I buy soy sauce in a large bulk container, I use this at the dinner table. It works great, allows for a huge range of pouring speeds (from tiny drops to full on stream) which makes it excellent for cooking too. Made of very nice materials (glass/metal), and it looks great. Plus, it's super easy to clean.\n",
      "\n",
      "No complains!\n",
      "good product, just little big too small, slightly bigger is perfect.\n",
      "Excellent size, easy to fill and to pour. Always dribbles a little bit after each use, though, so have to keep it on a little plate when stored in the cupboard.\n",
      "Functions as designed\n",
      "I had great hopes for this waffle iron. It wasn't a Belgian one; we love old fashioned waffles and hoped this was an old fashioned machine. Simple and durable. Two stars and returned. First of all the waffles are small, perhaps an inch less in diameter than waffle irons past. Secondly now matter how carefully we measured the mix, it always overflowed and this machine is very difficult to clean as the mix heads for the hinge in the back and the dial in the front. Neither is protected from the overflow and both are very difficult to clean. Last, no matter how we varied the mix and the settings we could not create crisp and light waffles. Note this was a refurbished unit, but it looked like new out of the box. Unfortunately, back into the box it went.\n",
      "WORKS GREAT.\n",
      "Five stars\n",
      "Heats up quickly and bakes quickly and reasonably evenly. Good for preparing quick meal for the two of us.\n",
      "I am loving this waffle-maker. It reaches cooking temperature quickly and has actually finished cooking the waffle when the indicator light glows. It is designed to be stored away with a very minimal footprint by standing it on its front end, and this would be my only area of complaint. When not in use it doesn't lock closed and  tends to shift about to a point it fails to remain shut once places in the storage position. It's not unwieldy or anything, it just demands you pay close attention when storing the unit, lest it slides apart, knocking that with which is was stored to the ground, if the unit itself does not hit the floor as well.\n",
      "Works great so far. Number indicator actually works for choosing light - medium - dark/crispy.\n",
      "I've been known to purchase refurbs before and never had any problems.......this was no exception!  Works great!  Just like new!  I decided on this one because 1. It's the perfect serving size for one person and 2. You can select your doeness and 3.  It's not a freaking Belgian waffle maker!!!  Those things are everywhere?!  You really have to look to find the classic style waffle maker?  What's up with that?  Anyway, this little thing cooks waffles great!  Very easy to clean even when you run the batter over?!  Just wipe it off while it's still warm with a paper towel or dishcloth and you're done.  Heats up pretty fast too.  I took a picture of the waffle I made with the setting just a little over the recommended setting #3, it did not disappoint me.  Came out perfect, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  My waffle isn't as puffed up as an original waffle would be, because I've been experimenting with Almond flour and Tapioca starch, But I have to say, it was very tasty!  Threw on some real melted butter and some Natural unstrained Honey and it's the bomb!  Are you still wondering what those two little notches on the left side of the waffle iron are for?  Those are for when you're done and wrapping the cord around the waffle maker, you then insert the end of the plug prongs into the notches so it holds the lid together, then you can store it upright without it falling open.  Needs a little fine tuning, but it works.  Very space saving.  Very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone.\n",
      "Yes!! This waffle iron is great. It's nice and heavy so it won't flop around on your counter as you fill / open the iron. Plenty of play in the hinge to let your waffle fluff up a little bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Really like the thin / classic shape-- it takes less waffle batter than a belgian waffle and works much better as a \"sandwich\" waffle! I made a few pizza waffles last night -- works great for this too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slim profile / design is what first caught my eye -- it's nice to look at and cleans up easily. Very adjustable in terms of temperature / browning --- I just make sure to pay attention to the indicator lights to tell me when it's done.\n",
      "Works great to make golden waffles. I like the clean design.\n",
      "Substantial in size and weight providing a very stable container. And, yes it's drip free.\n",
      "I really like this soy sauce dispenser. The liquid comes out cleanly, without dripping. Easy to wash and store.\n",
      "Love this item good size works well and is well made\n",
      "My family eats rice almost every night and so we buy soy sauce in bulk.  I had tried several other pour type bottle before this and they all leaked.  This one does not leak and just has a quality design look and feel.  We love it.\n",
      "Useless, hard to spray\n",
      "Convenience, nice looking and easy to clean. Pours well without dripping and doesn't take up much room at all. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Does't leak and a very good buy.\n",
      "Holds a lot of shoyu.  More than the Kikkoman decanter I replaced.  It has a clean look.  Very happy with it.\n",
      "It's pretty good, no leaks, no spills, the soysauce just comes out where it's supposed to. However the little flies can get in there... and they would drown, and then you pour out dead little flies with your soysauce...\n",
      "Solid, nice, pours smoothly. Looks great on the counter, instead of the Costco jug.\n",
      "Minimum dripping when you pour. Definitely recommend!\n",
      "well made at the right price! Like the diferent size boxes all stack together idea.\n",
      "I would give these a higher rating but the lids come off too easy when you lift by the handles.  Aside from that they are fantastic.  Very strong, and durable.  We used them for a myriad of things when we moved 500 + miles. Worked great.\n",
      "Works great! And most importantly it does not leak when pouring soy sauce.\n",
      "Lovely design and pours very steadily. i have had no problem with lockages so far.\n",
      "Nice size and works well.\n",
      "Came quickly and looks great!\n",
      "I love it!\n",
      "These bins are secure and strong. They seem like they will hold up to a lot of use and abuse.\n",

      "Highest quality soy sauce dispenser I've ever owned.  Highly recommended!\n",
      "This product actually works as it's supposed to and truly I do not find any rapid, uncontrolled dispensing of soy sauce.  The product is also nicely styled and well made.  It does not appear flimsy and or cheap.  Am quite delighted with it and would definitely recommend it.\n",
      "Love this little jar. I bought some artisan sou sauce which doesn't come with a pour spout, so this was the perfect solution. No drips and it's cute.\n",
      "arrived on time and as described.\n",
      "Very heavy weight and nice quality. Would look nice in any kitchen or on the table.\n",
      "Cutest little classy thing ever. Looks expensive and feels expensive. Pours out nicely with no mess left behind. Love this thing already!! Makes soy sauce look nice ;)\n",
      "A little pricey for a glass dispenser, but it is heavy duty and well made. Works very well.\n",
      "Just perfect\n",
      "Love it\n",
      "Really Great...\n",
      "So nice for condiments, soy sauce, fish sauce etc. Some of them just have\n",
      "some problems with air flow and you must close it tightly.  But it looks great\n",
      "and it comes in different sizes.\n",
      "The size is great. Loved how it matched my coffee maker ... looked great sitting beside it. But with only 10 months use, it stopped working without any warning. My guess is that I used it probably once every three weeks which equals approximately 12-14 total uses. Very disappointed especially since I always felt that Cuisinart was a top of-the-line name. As a result, I will probably think twice or never purchase another Cuisinart product.\n",
      "I just returned my second Cuisinart DCG-12BC Coffee Grinder, there will not be a third one.  Both of the grinders lasted less than 6 uses.  Each time the grinder failed I was almost done grinding.  I did not take time to disassemble the unit but my assumption is that they have a faulty thermal limiter: the unit starts to heat up and the thermal limiter, a safe fuse, pops.  Once the internal fuse shorts out it is back to the store or back to the manufacturer.  I highly recommend you do not waste your time with this faulty product.\n",
      "I debated getting a grinder since I buy my coffee grinded.  Also, there is no shortage of appliances in my kitchen.  But, after I made a decision to add flaxseed to my diet, I made room for a grinder.  Let me say Cuisinart is one of those reputable appliance names, so it was a no-brainer purchasing this one.  Although, I was hesitant doing so since it was remanufactured.  When it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised.  One would have never guessed it was reconditioned.  It was nicely sealed with no visible signs of handling and usage.  I have been using my grinder several times a day and have had no problems.  It is extremely simple to use and clean.  Of course, it has not been a month.  But, for what I paid, I have no regrets.\n",

      "\n",
      "Bad\n",
      "1) Rubber feet are VERY fragile. One came off and the exposed screw scratched the table\n",
      "2) Heats unevenly\n",
      "3) Too big if it's just the two of you. Also with such a large capacity it takes 2 packages of cheese to get enough fondue to dip - but that's far more than 2 people would normally eat.\n",
      "4) This thing is designed to boil several pints of oil for oil Fondue so it's way too powerful for cheese.  As a result it cycles on and off, intermittently overheating and then cooling off.\n",
      "5) Cord is way too short. It says you're NOT supposed to use an extension, but who has an outlet within 16\" inches of their dinner table?\n",

It has worked beautifully so far and folks were right, I really needed a burr grinder for my french press. I do notice the difference and it is certainly better than trying to eyeball the correct grind for my press. I have been very pleased with my blade grinder, a Capresso Cool Grind, but this is really better for my french press. The Cuisinart supreme grind burr mill seems well made, sturdy. It is a breeze to use and the grinds have been uniform and perfect for both the drip pot and the french press. Another plus is it's size. I would have to do two batches sometimes three for a full 12 cup drip pot when using my blade grinder. Now I can grind enough for a strong 12 cup brew in less time than grinding one batch with my blade grinder. I am very satisfied with this purchase, and as always Amazon's packing was excellent and shipping was fast.\n",

      "I like this grinder a lot and has served me well for the last 8 months, but I came across a Grindmaster GCG-1 on c-list for $25. All I can say is although the Cuisinart is good for what it is and Id still be using it, if it wasn't for me getting this great deal on the commercial grinder. There is a huge difference between the consistency of the grind and flavor. (I really had no idea there would be this much of a difference or a difference at all) I can now tast the difference. The smaller grinder has a different taste being the beans get a little heated when grinded also they are not consistent in size. If u can hunt online for a used commercial unit, do it! If not this will do the job. Now when I grind beans my coffee tastes identical to D&D and taste exactly like my favorite deli (they sell me 5lb bags there) no matter what I did with the cuisinart I could not recreate the taste, actually I think its better at my house, because I use bottled water. I also use a commercial Bunn coffee maker (also a $30 c-list buy). Before I got into perfecting coffee, myself and everyone I know would make good coffee, but there is something about commercial equipment and a good consistent water, that crosses the line from a good home coffee making, to crossing into making coffee like a pro. Also if u hate the sound of a blender, then u will not like this machine it is loud and takes 3-4xs as long to grind 1 1/2 ounces, the commercial unit does it in 4.1 seconds and its barely heard, commercial machines hummmm and at 4:30 in the morning that makes a huge difference! Overall for $30 Id recommend it, its a heck of a lot better than buying preground coffee. Just let say, so u people don't think Im scuzzy and just buy used stuff and away I go. I spent about 3-3 1/2 hours disassembling scrubbing and disinfecting each machine so they were as clean as new before I used them, because I know a lot of people would be saying to themselves, Id never buy used/dirty coffee machines.\n",
      "I've put my Cuisinart DBM-8FR Supreme Grinder to serious use and highly recommend it for convenience, durability, quality and price. It delivers whatever grind you desire in whatever quantity you need up to ten cups, and the bin holds almost ten ounces of beans. This unit may not compare to ones costing several hundred dollars, but it is waaaaay better than manual mills and comparably-priced electric blade grinders.\n",
      "It's fast, but the grind result is not that even. Some large pieces, some very fine and then \"most of the rest\" in the middle. If you are used to a quality grinder, you will probably be happier investing in another brand.\n",
      "for the price this is the best grinder\n",
      "I have several burr grinders, the others with portafilter accommodations, dose control and other high-end features. I bought this machine to grind beans for my school office French Press and pour over coffee. I had one for years for similar purposes and gave it to one of my children for his first apartment during college. He still uses it. These are real workhorses. I am not a big fan of plastic reservoirs where static electricity invariably hangs on to grind dust on its walls but, for this kind of sundry general grinding, I am very happy with the Cuisinart DBM 8FR.\n",
      "We had two handheld grinders that broke before I finally gave in and decided to upgrade to a nicer burr grinder. I am soooo glad I did. This grinder is far and away better than a handheld grinder. It can grind so much more coffee at once, which is important in our household of coffee drinkers, and you can control the grind so much better than in a handheld grinder. I can actually get coarse ground coffee for cold brew and french press which has made our coffee much better. I think the prices of burr grinders are insane considering all they do is grind beans, but for the prince, convenience, and features, this grinder definitely lived up to my expectations.\n",
      "Bought this after a bit of looking.  Fresh ground beans make better coffee.  This is a slick little unit, measures out the amount of coffee needed for a given pot.  You can set it for up to 12 cups of coffee and presto, instant grind.  It is a little noisy but it's a grinder.  This was a refurbished unit but it looks brand new.\n",
      "works great every morning with my Technivorm coffee maker!\n",
      "Good reliable grinder at a good price.\n",
      "Great value, great looks and size. Looks like a quality made product, happy so far and many choices of grinds and it isn't nearly as noisy as my last one. Would recommend this Cuisinart Coffee Bean Grinder to my friends.\n",
      "Works great. My only complaint is that it took too long to receive it.\n",
      "This grinder is unmercifully loud. Cuisinart got lucky and hit a price point that for some unfathomable reason no other\n",
      "manufacturer has been able to duplicate..Tons of these monsters have been sold. This machine is louder than a\n",
      "vacuum cleaner..It's an atrocity. Plus, Cuisinart is trading off its name and continues to produce products in all categories\n",
      "that last a short lifetime. Shameful corporate larceny !\n",
      "Very well designed. It has a very high bean capacity. Works quite well\n",
      "Came DOA. Sent back to try again.\n",
      "The burr grind is great. Makes a difference.\n",
      "My 3-star rating is because of one big flaw: The duration of the grind is set each time by turning a spring-loaded dial.\n",
      "It starts grinding as soon as the dial begins to turn and consistent amounts of coffee are hard to achieve.\n",
      "It's no $300 grinder, but it's miles better than the blade grinders and does an acceptable job overall for my purposes. I use a French Press and I get a pretty even ground at the right size every time...delicious home pressed coffee every day. I took a star off because they could have at least provided it with an anti-static grind catcher, I mean how much more could it have cost? I purchased a refurbished model and have been using it for about 6 months now with no problems whatsoever. I would def buy this model again...brand new or refurbished either one!\n",

      "I thought I would let anyone interested know that after 14 months my unit is still going strong. The grinder has had absolutely no issues, the grind is consistent and I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a reasonably priced burr grinder.\n",
      "Crapped out totally in no time\n",
      "Best and easiest to use. Burr grinder. I'm loving how quick and easy this is to use. I'd definitely recommend this product.\n",
      "works great\n",
      "Grinds way better than my old blade-based grinder. It makes a bit of a mess when you take the ground coffee catch in and out. Grind consistency is good for the price.\n",
      "Suitable for drip coffee machines, but definitely not fine enough for an espresso grind, unless you're using a pressurized portafilter basket.\n",
      "This is my first burr grinder so I don't know what to compare it to. So far i like it. it's quick and make a lovely espresso grind. My only grip is with the container that holds the ground coffee. It's very messy. When opening the top, coffee spills all over the counter and trying to get the coffee is a hassle as it's square so you have to tap it into the scoop and again it gets all over the place. other than that, it's a good product so far. I trust nothing these days to last..\n",
      "Doesn't grind *quite* right for Espresso, but does great for my coffee press.\n",
      "Excellent\n",
      "Very nice Grinder....\n",
      "I really like this timer, it is easy to use and just what I was looking for. Not complicated and that works for me.\n",
      "Easy to  set up and use.\n",
      "Large numbers- easy to read from a distance.\n",
      "Different function buttons are different colors.\n",

      "Timer beep is LOUD- I am able to work in the garden while timer is inside and I can still hear it.\n",
      "Magnetic backing is great- (just wish it had something on the back to hang it on a nail or hook).\n",
      "Timer does the job = ease of mind.\n",
      "Love it. I wasn't sure I would be satisfied because I haven't bought anything refurbished. This was my first and I'm very pleased with this grinder. I've used it for a pot of coffee as well as a travel size mug. It measures well and creates the best grind.\n",
      "This is my second one. The first one lasted almost 10 years. Love this. Only draw back is the plastic parts around the burr grinder - that's what gave out on mine.\n",
      "this is used 24 hrs a day my only complaint is that it can not be taken apart to wash\n",
      "I did love this while it worked. I have tried two, both of which lasted just a couple days over the 90 day return time. I got a similar Mr. Coffee and hope for better results.\n",
      "I have been using this refurbished unit for 3 months now and it works great.  I thought it died on my, but it turns out I had not pushed in the grind catcher completely.  It is not hard to only get it partially in, and it is not obviously just looking at the unit.  Now that I know, I never have a problem - just push it in firmly.\n",
      "Attractive item but defective its under powered and noisy.  If the hopper is loaded with coffee it will sometimes not start running and you have to empty it. Then start running it before you put coffee in the unit to grind.\n",
      "It does everything it's suppose to do, and I could not tell it was refurbished. I'm surprised some comments marked this grinder down because it's noisy; it's a coffee grinder, it should be loud. A fine product I would buy again.\n",
      "I have no problems buying Referbed Items and this is no exception. On its' own, this is a great little Burr Mill grinder. But that I got it for about $30 makes it all the better. The only complaint I have is the Slider on the unit to choose how many cups of coffee you want to brew. We use a 12 cup brewer so I set the slider to 12. Now in theory, it will grind exactly how much coffee is needed for that quantity and then shut off automatically. It did shut down automatically however the amount of coffee it ground was far more than would be needed. Aside from that, I like this grinder and I am glad I bought it.\n",
      "This is my second Cuisinart Coffee Grinder.  My first performed very well for many years but suffered an electrical failure.  I believe we caused the failure by pulling out the hopper to stop the grinding if over filled.  I would not recommend doing this as it causes the switch which prevents the coffee from grinding if the hopper is not in place to be hit with the full voltage when activated.  If you should need to stop grinding either because you have run out of coffee or the hopper is full it is recommended that you pull the plug or slid the grinding selector to off.  This grinder should last for years and years if not 'abused' as we did.\n",
      "Worked great first few times and then had problems with motor heating up.\n",
      "I bought this for my daughter to use with her daughters when they were working on homework or other tasks so they could be reminded time was passing.  She and her two oldest daughters have attention deficit issues and she is trying to not use medication except when it is really necessary.  Timers are a great help in training children with these disorders when they are of a mild sort.  This timer changes colors and gives the child a warning their time limit for the task at hand is counting down. I don't like this timer as well as some of the others I have purchased as it only gives warning of the last minute.  It does work well, however, so for kitchen use it should be just great.\n",
      "I really enjoyed this timer.  Great size on the numbers, easy to use buttons, and the outer color changes as you're nearing the end of your time so you get a visual indicator about the upcoming beep.  Unfortunately, my timer didn't live for as long as I'd hoped - by the time it reached the tender age of 2, the display had stopped working (though beeping continued to function).  Replacing the batteries wasn't the solution, so sadly I had to find a replacement.\n",
      "I love how big the display is and that it lights up with the countdown. My only real complaint is that there is no way to decrease time! So if its set for 30 minutes and you need it set for 15, you have to reset the time completely! And it beeps each time you hit the buttons- rather loudly. So for our small apartment, when I have to reset the time and my daughters asleep, I have to muffle the sound of the beeps with a towel. And really, that's not too ad to deal with. The reset part can get annoying though!\n",
      "I enjoy electronics and lights! This timer is fun in that it flashes green, then yellow, then it beeps as red flashes to remind you to get back to the kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is fun...but limited to one timer (and ninety nine minutes). I purchased a second Polder Traffic Light as well and gave them as gifts.\n",
      "Believe it or not, I spent a lot of time looking for a kitchen timer to replace an old Westclox that I liked quite a bit.  This one is very well-designed -- it flashes green, yellow, then red as it counts down the final minutes.  It has a magnet on the back so it can stick to your stove, but it is also shaped so it can sit on a counter at a slight angle for easy reading.  The numbers are nice and big.  It's a very simple little gadget but it's a pleasure -- I may buy a second one.\n",
      "Great for the price. This is a second purchase because the one I had for a year clogged up and motor burned up because I tried to regrind already ground coffee. Live and learn.\n",
      "I don't want you to buy this and think you are going to get an even grind, like for ESPRESSO, this thing doesnt grind EVEN AT ALL!!! its super funny\n",
      "We've had 2 of these, and they both stopped functioning properly after a few months. They were never dropped, abused or misused; they simply stop working. It's too bad, because the design and functionality is quite good while it worked.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've since bought a LUX CU100&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Lux-CU100-Digital-Count-Up-Down-Timer-White/dp/B000FCEQMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Lux CU100 Digital Count Up/Down Timer, White</a>, and have been very pleased with both its design and durability. What's more, it's less expensive than the Polder.\n",
      "I bought one of these, based on experience with a different Polder model.  However, segments of its LCD numerals began to fail after about 6 months, making it impossible to read.  I bought a second one.  Its \"Start/Stop\" button failed in about 6 month.  Both of these units had very light household use under clean conditions.  Verdict:  Looks nice, but is basically junk in terms of reliability.\n",
      "With this timer I'm surprised you can turn the light feature on/off but not the sound.  With a visual indicator, it's rather obvious that some might prefer to see the timer instead of always hear it but Polder missed the opportunity here.  The display is large but numbers become a little hard to read when the backlight is illuminated--it turns Green when the last minute is counting down, then Orange for the last 30 seconds, and swtiches red to the last ten seconds before cycling colors when the time is up.\n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite digital kitchen timer used to be made by Polder but now I see it's called General Tools TI150 3-in-1 Timer for the Visually and Hearing Impaired\" on this site.  It has a choice of: vibrate, light, or beep (and any combination of them) for a more discreete or useful timer.\n",
      "Cool idea but it just didn't work very well.  The \"traffic light\" feature is tied to 1 minute which makes it mostly useless.  If you have something in the oven that takes an hour, do you really care about the very last minute?  Either adjustablility or a percentage based approach would have worked out much better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since it didn't work in the kitchen, I decided to use it for workouts.  It was actually great for this for a little while.  Having an easy to see indicator that you are in the last minute is great for letting you know when to give it an all out effort.  Unfortunately, the entire top row of display elements have stopped working making it a little awkward for timing anything.  I changed the batteries and it didn't help so I can only assume a hardware problem.  Not a good sign for something that just sat around for a few months.\n",
      "Great design (3 colors), the loud alarm, magnetization - a very good impression. I think this product can be recommended for all.\n",
      "It's easy to set, although for longer times it's tedious to press the \"minute\" button so many times.\n",
      "\n",
      "The alarm is of medium volume and carries on for a while.\n",
      "\n",
      "The way the lights work on this item aren't intuitive.  With 1 minute remaining it turns GREEN.  With 30 seconds remaining it turns ORANGE.  With 10 seconds remaining it turns RED.  When the time is up it cycles through all the colors as it rings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Personally, I think it should be green while it's timing, then turn ORANGE when 30% of the time is remaining, then turn red when 5 or 10% of the time is remaining.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you time 2 minutes it makes sense to turn orange at 30 seconds.  But if you time 40, you still don't have a gradual winding down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, it's a neat item and seems to work relatively well, but the lights don't work the way I'd hoped.\n",
      "I use my timer for nearly everything:reading time,kid's showers,time-out,baking,exercising etc......\n",
      "It is the most durable timer I have ever bought!\n",
      "Before this timer,I would replace timers an average of once a month!!!!\n",
      "My Polder traffic light timer has been working for over a year!\n",
      "Highly recommended-I own 5 of these!\n",
      "I really liked this timer, I used it for a whole year. I really liked the lights changing color before the time is up, because I can be busy with other things like the computer and TV and the other timer I have (a 4-channel one) is not very loud so I often don't even hear it. Pros: Loud enough, the lights that turn on before the time is up, and also, if you use it often for a set amount of time, it has some 'memory' that remembers the last time you entered.  Cons: A little cumbersome to set up the time, since it only has the hours and minutes, so if you are making something that takes 45 minutes, you would have to press the minute button 45 minutes. If you use it often for a set amount of time, it has some 'memory' that remembers the last time you entered. I would recommend it if you don't move it, don't trust the little magnets on the back, this timer is too heavy for those magnets. I brushed it with my arm and it fell on the floor -a fall from about 4 feet high- and the screen broke into little pieces. I have other timers and I have used many diferent kinds of them and this is the first time that something shatters like that when dropped. If you plan on keeping it in a flat surface and never move it, I recommend it. If you want to move it around, get something else.\n",
      "Purchased this refurbished unit after our original one (same model) died after 2 years.  The refurb has a 90 day warranty and it stopped grinding after 4 months - just after the warranty expired. The original we purchased was NOT refurbished and although it lasted 2 years, the last year it was problematic.  Sometimes it would grind, other times we had to keep pushing the button hoping it would catch and grind.  This unit IS NOT very durable but if you do decide to purchase, do not buy a refurbished one since you only receive a 3 month warranty rather than 1 year if new.  While not expensive, you would think it would function for a bit longer.  I wrote Cuisinart and they could nothing.  I am very disappointed and most certainly will not purchase any appliance manufactured by Cuisinart.\n",
      "Was hoping it would grind a little bit finer, but it's a good product for the money.\n",
      "A bit loud. But other than that it is fine and is working well. The noise is the only reason I downgraded the stars.\n",
      "This is our third purchase of this grinder.  We use one everyday in our home (have had it for 4 years), and we have one in our motor home as well.  The one in the motor home experienced some water damage after an unfortunate plumbing leak, so we had to replace it.  I looked around a bit, but couldn't see any reason not to go with the same one that we've been so happy with.  This did not disappoint, and in fact, I used this one to replace the one in our kitchen, and the old kitchen one went our to the motor home!  I have seen reviews mentioning sudden stopping - this has happened to ours as well, but just indicates a need to clean out the area where the coffee shoots into the bin.  After a quick clean out, it always works perfectly.\n",
      "I got this as a visual count down timer for work. I assumed, incorrectly, that the color changes where based off a percentage of total time. But rather, they are static values of 1 min, 30 sec. 10 sec.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I use this in a shared working environment, I also hoped that there would be a \"silent\" mode. But there was not. So I just opened it up and cut the speaker wire. Now I have a silent, visual, alarm that does 90% of what I wanted it to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "I plan to hack in a switch for the speaker wire I cut, so I have the option to enable sound again, if desired.\n",
      "I recently had to replace my faithful old \"crank\" mechanical timer, and since the reviews of this type of product were very negative, I chose the Polder Traffic Light Kitchen Timer. The one I received is accurate, but it is a bit of a hassle to use. The time is set by repeatedly pressing the 1-minute button, which produces a rather jarring beep. Setting any time over 10 minutes is an incredibly repetitive task that is very hard on the ears. Other than that, the unit is useful.\n",
      "I really like having fresh ground coffee in the morning, with the push of a button it couldn't be any easier.\n",
      "This works great. I have used this to grind coarse coffee for french press and cold press, as well as finer coffee for pour over. Grinds perfectly every time, and can hold a lot of coffee! Worth the extra cash.\n",
      "this small little timer works nicely fit out of the way and can be heard and seen from along way off great piece of kitchen equiptment\n",
      "This is a very functional timer.  The up and down timer is nice.  The readout is large and clear. The \"Traffic Light\" alert system has limitations. A little tough on batteries if you use the light alarm system.\n",
      "\n",
      "The alarm tone is not loud enough if you are using this in a noisy environment or are working a fair distance away from it.  Being advertised as a product for the hearing impaired, I expected the alarm to be much louder.  Having the \"Traffic Light\" alert system is only useful if you are visually monitoring the timer...in which case you could do as well with a wrist watch or wall clock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Polder has great customer service.  They sent me a replacement when I called to ask about the soft alarm.  The replacement unit was just as quiet.  :-(\n",
      "I came across this when I was looking for something simple and quick to help our kids with beginning to learn their independence with time management. I previously used the \"Learning Resources Time Tracker\" for the kids, and though it's much more visual and has some neater features, it's not reasonable for quick use and was a bit of a pain, so I ended up never using it. We've had this timer for close to a year and have not had any of the problems noted by other reviewers. We have found many uses for it over that time, though we primarily use it for the kids at play time or for *taking turns* with something. (There's no personal/emotional response to a timer that does the exact same time for everyone.) We also used it to help my middle son with potty training. We set it for the specific minute range (the time increased as he got more control/awareness), and when the timer went off, he had to stop what he was doing, go potty, etc., then come back out and hit the start button again. This helped him feel more independent about the process, which was a big plus in the training process. The kids really like the different light colors (which makes it more of a positive/fun tool than a negative), and if you keep it in visual range, they often see it light up for the last minute, so there is a warning that the time is almost up. I also like that it starts to count back up once the timer goes off, so you know how long it's been since it went off (in case kids choose to ignore it). The alarm sound is loud enough to hear, but not overbearing, and has a good beeping tone that's not obnoxious. The only thing that would be a nice additional feature is if it made a single beep when the light turns on for the last minute to have an audible warning as well as a visual one.\n",
      "Great timer, well made, easy to use, strong mounting magnet, the lights are a nice touch.\n",
      "Solid machine and easy to use. half the price of a new one!\n",
      "This product works great.  I bought the refurbished model and saved a lot.  I could not tell any difference between this and a totally new one.  Adjusting grind settings is really easy.  Also, the grind cup capacity and start/stop feature adjustment work well.  I really like this unit and hope it lasts a long time.  It is a little larger than I thought, but that is not a problem.\n",
      "We're amazed at the difference between ground coffee and milled coffee! We are also saving money: we seem to use about 1/3 less burred beans to make coffee as strong as we made with ground beans. Great device, and great price: don't bother getting a $200 burr mill when this one is available at a reasonable, consumer-friendly price!\n",
      "One month old and the motor is fried. Thought Cuisinart was a good brand, guess not. Opened it up to take a look and it is just a cheap piece of junk. Why can't anything be made good in this country anymore.\n",
      "I was happy to see the light on this timer also back-lights the LCD display!  Not many timers do that so this was an added plus.  Having said that, I do wish I could control how long the light stays on though.  As it is, it just stays on a few seconds before it turns off.  But I do like the 3 color alerts, tipping me off to when the timer is about to go off, and then repeatedly flashing when time's up.  Also, it arrived with the LCD screen all messed up -- I thought I was going to have to return it, but I gently rubbed my finger over the LCD screen in circular motions and it leveled off the LCD so it would display digits properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "FYI - the entire white surface on the face of the timer illuminates when the timer lights up -- green, yellow/orange and red.  And the LCD screen lights up too.  Large digits help make this very easy to see and read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this cost a bit more than I care to admit spending on a timer, but it is pretty cool.  I'm happy with it.\n",
      "Works great, like everyone else says.  I use it in the kitchen, and wish it'd beep for a 5 min warning.  Instead its just lights, not so handy if you aren't standing in the kitchen.  So I give it 4 stars.\n",
      "This is a good little timer.  I like that I can time over 60 min.  It will ring for a bit then start counting up so you know how far past the time you went if you did not shut it off.  The only thing it doesn't do that I wish it did is to haved a back up feature.  You either need to go all the way around if you miss your target or reset and start over.\n",
      "\n",
      "A nice feature is that it saves your last time if you go through the complete timing cycle. For example: set for 15 minutes and hit stop when it goes off.  It will show 15 minutes ready for you to hit start again instead of resetting to zero.  If you stop mid cycle in timing it will restart where you stopped it.  To set a new time you need to clear and reset a time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also like that it takes a regular battery vs a watch type that I never have in the house.\n",
      "Well made\n",
      "Excellent for the price. A great low cost grinder\n",
      "I just got this item today and so far I like it. The good features are the large size of the digits, the fact that it's easy to set, and the price. I do think a couple things could be better: the feature for it to sit on a table-top at an angle is one of the reasons I purchased it, but it's not angled up enough to really see the digits without being on top of it. Still it's nice that you can set it on a table, or flip the piece down in the back and stick it to something with the magnet. The other thing that could be better are the lights that come on when there is a certain amount of time left on the timer- -while a nice feature, the only one you can see well is the green light that goes on when there is 1 minute left. The other two lights are harder to see. All-in-all a decent timer for the money.\n",
      "I recently purchased this timer through Amazon, and am very happy with it. I find the lights useful, and also appreciate that you can defeat them if you so choose. And the buzzer volume is plenty loud for me. The unit has 3 very strong magnets on the back for mounting to a metal surface. I did find that they are rather smooth, so when I put it on a vertical surface it had a tendency to slide down. But I solved this problem by applying some foam tape to each magnet. The magnets are strong enough to hold through the tape and it no longer slides. I like that it counts up after it ends, and it will remember the last timer setting. And it uses three AAA batteries, which should provide a long life. The only thing I don't like is the buttons to set the time only go up, so if you go past the time you wanted to set you must clear it and start over. But that hasn't been a big problem for me.\n",
      "My third try with this timer just failed, as usual it was the digital readout, which started displaying partial, thus illegible, numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "I kept buying and trying this thing because in all other respects it is close to perfect.  Still, three failures can be no accident, just sloppy quality control.\n",
      "Easy to use. Easy to see. Easy to hear. The colors make it even easier from really far away.\n",
      "Best buy ever.  I got tired of paying $90 for Capresso.  Frequent cleaning or else risk a jam.  I made a simple error of putting the grinder in upside Dow and couldn't free the part.. I threw out ( our third) and bought the refurbished Cuisinart. It's much easier to use and clean and for 1/3 the price of the Capresso, it it far superior\n",
      "We were using a manual grinder for our percolator which I was perfectly happy with until the locking screw kept stripping. So I thought I would get us a refurbished grinder because the price was right and it was basically hands free. I write reviews hoping that someone will take my advice (good or bad) and use it to help them in deciding on their purchase of a product. I just need to learn to take other's advice instead of just blowing it off and going it on my own and not trusting anyone like i'm used to. How can you trust me if I don't trust you? So trust me when I say this, refurbished is junk with some shiny new screws in it. The neck to my hopper snapped in half  when my husband was trying to grind a pot of coffee. I only removed that hopper once to clean it. Customer service will be getting a call, tomorrow. They don't refund, just replace or repair. Lovely! Good luck if you purchase one.\n",
      "Seriously.  This conversation has happened many times in our house since we got this grinder.  We've only had it two months (and maybe it's my fault because I risked buying a refurbished one), but it's already yelling and complaining about having to do its ONE JOB.  We had a Krups burr grinder before and I miss it.  I miss its lack of noise.  This Cuisinart is ridiculously loud.  I've tried to put a pot holder under it to help and now I'll I have a coffee-powder-stained pot holder.  We either grind beans in the evening or after our kids are awake because it's so loud in our house.  And we would much rather drink coffee BEFORE the kids are awake.\n",
      "\n",
      "This thing likes to whine and whine without taking any beans from the hopper into the blades, so that makes it even louder.  It also makes us try to eyeball how much more we need to grind to make a full pot's worth of coffee.  My husband had to grind it 3 different times last night to get 12 cups' worth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, and static, while standard with plastic cups and burr grinders, seems to be worse on this one.  Some of the bits should be big enough to stay in, but somehow they leap right out onto the counter, the floor, my wrist, my shirt...\n",
      "\n",
      "I just ordered a Capresso in hopes that it will be a welcome relief from this beast.  It was almost $60 more, but we really REALLY like our coffee.\n",
      "Very easy and simple to use.  Only problem is pouring the grains out of the container can get a little messy.  It does come with a two-sided scoop/brush wish comes very handy.  Overall great grinder.  Save me time a few more minutes every morning when I make my cup of joe as I prefer to grind my coffee right before every cup.  I put away my small individual grinder and use this cool machine!\n",
      "Got to to replace and old machine same model.  Old one lasted many years.  This was the best grinder out there in my opinion.  Just used this one twice and seems a bit less loud than the first one.  Seems to work just as good as the first one I purchased years ago.  Will update if there is any changes with this Refurbished grinder.\n",
      "NOTE:  When I grind coffe early before the rest wakes up, I wrap blanket around it and it muffles the sound incase its too loud for early morning.\n",
      "so far so good with this one\n",
      "This is the best Burr Grinder I've found for the price. It is pretty large and barely fits under my cabinet. The grinds easily stick to the container and you have to tap the container around and brush the grinds out. The design of the grinder makes the grind container messy to use, and the coarseness dial is operated by rotating the entire bean container, making the entire machine look asymmetrical when not in use (unless you want to change the grind size). The machine does not do an efficient job using the last of your beans. If I were to purchase a grinder again, i would pick the better-designed Baratza Encore, which is smaller and produces better grinds, but costs at least double.\n",
      "This is our second one in five years. When the first went out I figured it was a lemon. Now that we are 2 for 2, I think it's just a crap made-in-CHina product like very other. Sad to see a quality brand sell junk like this. We went back to our 25-year old Mr. Coffee grinder.  Don't waste your money.\n",
      "I really like this coffee grinder. I had just returned from my daughter's house, and this is the model she had, and it works great!!!\n",
      "Not a bad grinder.  I have a much higher quality one at home.  This one is for my RV, so I wanted a decent grinder to make French Press Coffee.  It does make a coarse grind, but there is quite a bit of fine powder mixed in.  Having the so much powder is why the rating lost a star. For my needs and not wanting to spend over $100, this one will work.  It does make noise, but what grinder doesn't?  The cup quantity feature is workable, but its really just a timer and I would have preferred a timer with time markings not cups to get the proper time set.\n",
      "It arrived in new packaging, and looked brand new.  I could find no evidence that this was a remanufactured unit.  So I you don't want to spend a lot of money, and realize that your not going to get the superior results of a higher level conical burr mill  grinder, I would recommend.\n",
      "Works Great--Reconditioned or not looked new works fine.\n",
      "Cheapest Price I could find anywhere\n",
      "This is my first electric burr grinder. For as much coffee as I drink I really haven't bothered to learn much about making coffee. All I really know is that I like freshly, consistently ground arabica beans that are brown, not black. I seriously need to advance my knowledge beyond that. I will say that this grinder produces a fair amount of fine dust along with any coarseness of grounds, which I'm told is the sign of a cheap coffee grinder. OTOH it does a night-and-day better job than my previous, blade-chopping \"grinder\". I had to choose a new grinder in a hurry because my old one broke down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also the static cling on the plastic hopper is pretty bad. I do what I read in another review: I just shake the grounds (and dust) out of the hopper through its intake hole. That keeps mess to a minimum. I bought a refurbished one since I figure such a grinder will have received much more QC attention than a standard assembly-line example. I also got the extended protection plan, which buys me a few years' worth of maintenance, which at least forestalls this thing's date with a landfill (SIGH)... I hate buying disposable appliances/amusements, but I was overwhelmed with research on grinders ranging from $30 to $3,000. My plan is to use this grinder to simply defer the decision. I will use this for [I think 3 years?] after which I expect it to expire and nobody will be willing to fix it. At that point I will have accumulated enough knowledge to purchase a grinder that I can use my whole life, and somebody else can enjoy it when I'm gone. My next/final one will be a highly regarded, serviceable, conical burr grinder with a glass receptacle - that's all I know so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that I'm thinking about it, the purchase price seems good until I consider that I'm really just buying time to figure out which grinder I really want. I'm not proud of buying something that was clearly designed to be disposable.\n",

      "EDIT 2016.05.20: I spent a week in Portland, and it pretty much ruined my life. Sampling the lifestyles there there has warped my mind like few things ever have. I now ride a bicycle pretty much everywhere I go - got rid of one car (share one with wife). I have lost all interest in chain restaurant food. After a week of swimming in really great coffee - culinary *experience* coffee - it's too hard to go back to my old, lower standards.\n",

      "I finally started to read up on home roasting and brewing. I bought a Lido 3 hand grinder and I hacked my second popcorn roaster to add temp and fan controls (fire hazard - don't do it)! I found Kansas City's only top-tier coffee joint, Oddly Correct, and I bug them with questions. I've been to About the Coffee once and plan to take some classes there. I took the factory tour at Roasterie.\n",

      "I think the Cuisinart was a good stepping stone for me. At the time I was hooked on \"good\" coffee but I wasn't interested enough to dump lots of hours into learning the whole process of making iteratively better coffee at home. This grinder is good in that it is reliable and consistent (from grind to grind). I put numbers on the coarseness dial with a fine Sharpie - returning to the click marked \"6\" will mean the same thing today that it did a year ago. A year ago my main problem with this grinder seemed like a quibble: it produces a lot of  fine dust. Now that I'm beefing up my skills in taking coffee from green beans to finished drink, this shortcoming is becoming a limiter.\n",

      "The static cling is annoying but I can totally live with that. I'm a hardcore coffee junkie now - to get my daily fix I would be stealing ratty old bicycles and smashing the front windows of pawn shops if it came to that.

Static cling is the least of my problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm satisfied that I took my coffee making as far as it  can go with this grinder. At the time of purchase I thought it was a real step up - going from a blade type coffee chopper to a grinder with \"burr\" in the name - WOW haha! It's like all my hobbies - all I needed when starting out was to *think* I had good gear and the excitement carried me through. And to be fair this grinder was a huge step up from a blade type chopper. I'm happy for the experience I had with this Cuisinart grinder, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone wanting to make good coffee.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm satisfied that I got my money's worth out of it - I bought a refurbished one with a 3-year warranty, which was the epitome of cheap reliability.

      "Here is my advice to people who want the whole coffee experience - zen rituals of preparation, culinary exploration, etc. Plan to invest in an immersive hobby. Invest in the following order:\n",
      "\n",
      "TIME: research, finding the best coffee joint in town, taking classes, plan a vacation around coffee tasting and learning. start by finding people who demonstrate their expertise by handing you a cup of the best coffee you've ever had. everyone can talk, but not everyone can roast and brew. those who can, can recommend books\n",

      "GEAR: roaster, grinder, brew gear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stay on guard for gear fetishism - it seems to affect a lot of coffee enthusiasts. Remember that you love *coffee* - not coffee *gear*. For me a reliable guide to gear and utility is to stand in a room, meditate for a minute, open my eyes, and ask, \"What in here is ugly?\" - and then get rid of the ugly things. Ugliness extends to every criterion: utility, aesthetics, undefined sensibilities. When used as my exclusive method - i.e. no \"What's the best I can get?\" or \"What are the available choices?\" - I end up with very good gear that works great and looks appropriate for my house. I end up with the *right* gear. A consort of good coffee gear is like an ad-hoc sculpture - perfection is achieved by removing that which doesn't belong. Adding more *stuff* is generally a step in the wrong direction.\n",

      "Aggressively avoid advertising for coffee gear, which includes the pap that passes for journalism. It's like *Raiders of the Lost Ark*: one look and you will be destroyed.\n",

      "Focus on one thing at a time. Probably stay in the area of brewing first, then move on to roasting. Progressively wean off the best, fresh-roasted beans in town to your own, home-roasted beans. Forget about incremental gear upgrades - spend your resources figuring out what you like (hands-on) and then do what it takes to acquire the necessary skills and gear. For me I don't really need flexibility or programmability or automation - I just want to consistently get the best results possible with a reasonable amount of time and effort. The Cuisinart grinder did that for me for a couple years, but because of my rising skill level, it is no longer suitable. It has become ugly, and as such must be relegated to storage.\n",

      "The only indication I had that it wasn't new was a 90-day warranty card insert!  Works well, but although it can grind espresso, it is not capable of the finest espresso grind. Also, some might find that the coarsest grind is not coarse enough for French Press.\n",
      "A consistent grind without fine powder. Think it cuts down on bitterness. Better than a grinder.  Maybe a more expensive conical would be better, but like this for now.\n",
      "I just bought it and so my review will not be as informative as someone who's used it for months or years. I do want to say that my unit came as new as it could be. It was boxed and made to look new.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is my second burr mill and this one is better than the other one that died on me after years of good use. This one is quieter (relatively speaking) and more uniform in grinding. Really like it so far.\n",
      "I've had the Cuisinart DBM-8 for 10 years before it gave up the ghost a month or so ago.  I replaced it with a factory reconditioned (DBM-8FR) and expect the new unit will also give me a decade of good service.\n",
      "this is about the cheapest way you are going to find a decent coffee grinder, but it is definitely not the best.  Yes, this grinder will work to grind coffee for your drip coffee maker, but the grinds are not consistent.  You especially get a lot of coffee bean dust that sticks to the the sides of the collection cup due to all the static that builds up as it grinds.  And the product itself, of which I have had several, only seems to last about 2 years.  So I recently broke down and spent $200 on a wonderful Breville grinder that has a wide range of grinds and a wide range of capacities, and grinds the beans in a consistent fashion.  I love it.  I am only hoping that it lasts at least ten years so I will really get my money's worth.\n",
      "The price was a bargain, but I miss my trouble free cuisinart coffee grinder.  This burr mill is great, but you need to be cautious about two items, one, the darn coffee comes out loaded with static electricity so it sticks to the plastic receptacle where the ground coffee sits, and two, the French Roast coffee I use must be oily, because after several weeks this mill literally craps out without warning, no motor, nothing;  in this case, Cuisinart does not tell you, but you need to peek at the output spout of the mill where it shoots the ground coffee, take a screwdriver and sort of pry the jammed coffee grounds out of the spout, then the mill works like before.  I have a feeling most people faced with the latter situation, just give up and trash the mill. Again, I think if I ever get tired of my mill, I'll go back to my trusty coffee grinder.\n",
      "I really thought this was going to be great! Ordered it, got it home, made coffee. Turned the grinder to Fine and tried it.  Seemed OK, but did not seem very fine.  Left it, came back the next morning and made a full pot of coffee. Put the indicator to the maximum Fine setting.  After pouring the coffee, I pulled out the grinds and checked the left overs.  With my blade grinder, the grounds look like slick, dark brown mud, but this thing didn't get that fine, it looked like beach sand texture. I am sending it back. It is nice to have a one touch grinder but not when it doesn't do the job well enough, and I don't want to have to pour the grinds through a second time just to get it fine enough.\n",

      "We had a burr coffee bean grinder for the past six years. It's major shortcoming was the small amount of roasted beans that it held. Needing replacement, this Cuisanart has a much larger storage capacity for the beans, a real convenience. The motor seems more powerful than our old grinder yet its sound remains relatively quiet for the work it does. The ground coffee is easy to remove without spilling, The \"reconditioned\" lowered our purchase price but not the quality. Definitely a good appliance. I might add that we roast our own beans. With that added labor for a good cup of coffee, we also expect our grinder to compliment the entire coffee brewing process.\n",
      "I bought a reconditioned burr grinder and it works great. I like to dial in the amount I want and let it do the work. It's convenient to simply fill the hopper and just push the button. The downside if it has one is that it is noisy. But I am used to this since all grinders are noisy. Just leave the fresh ground coffee in the container till you need it. Its small enough to push to the side and out of the way of your counter space. Very easy to use.\n",
      "We bought one of these new from Amazon and it was okay for a little over a year. Then it simply stopped grinding. I called Cuisinart customer service and was told not to even bother shipping it to them for repair because Cuisinart didn't repair them. Another piece of shoddy merchandise that ends in the trash because it didn't stand up to a year of infrequent and careful use. There was a time when the Cuisinart brand meant something. I don't feel that way any more.\n",
      "I am so glad I purchased this!  It works just like it is new and came packaged as though it was fresh from production.  I had bought a reconditioned toaster oven from Cuisinart, and it worked great too!  I would trust this company to purchase other reconditioned goods as well.\n",

      "**** Update**** 12/2008\n",
      "I've had this bed for 18 months now.  I stand by my previous review.  This bed is the biggest reason I hate traveling now.  I've not woken up with an ache or pain from poor sleeping since I got this bed, and the price is still well below that of a conventional mattress.  No sags or problems - still as wonderful as it was 14 months ago when I wrote my first review.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are you waiting for?\n",
      "\n",
      "***Update 10/2012\n",
      "I can't believe it's been 5 years.  The bed is still, by far, the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. Still no problems, still a great night's sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "***Update 10/2015\n",
      "8 years now.  Still love this bed.  I'm thinking it may be time to start looking at replacing it; although I still find it very comfortable and have no problems with it I have purchased new mattresses for my kids in the last few years and can tell the difference in firmness - this one has started to go a little soft.  For the price, the years of great sleep we've gotten out of it have been a bargain!\n",
      "The \"12\" Deluxe California King Therapeutic w/5\" Memory Foam Mattress Bed with Dual AirFlow System\" is an excellent mattress for an excellent price, in comparison to what else is available on the market. I spent a lot of time shopping around prior to purchasing this mattress. I checked out all the mattresses advertised on television and available at a nationwide department store. Though I saw quite a few mattresses that I liked, I found the prices being asked for them insanely expensive, and way beyond what I could reasonably afford.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since I was unable to sleep the entire night in my old high quality brand name inner spring mattress, I thought that I was condemned to sleeping a large portion of the night in my more comfortable brand name recliner, as I had done for about two years prior to purchasing this mattress. As I got older, I developed back problems; and sleeping on my old inner spring mattress only aggravated my back problems, and I would wake up constantly throughout the night as a result of being uncomfortable, and then I would wake up in the morning with intense back pain. Sleeping on this mattress has alleviated my insomnia and morning back pain. This mattress is very, very comfortable, and the zippered cover enclosing the mattress is very, very soft and well made.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are a couple of drawbacks. I find that my wife tends to oversleep in the morning ever since she has been sleeping in our new Sleep Shop mattress, requiring me to wake her up every morning so that she won't be late for work. No fooling! I also made the mistake of letting my children try out the mattress. Now, they want one just like it, but apparently Sleep Shop does not currently sell a standard size 12\" or 10\" memory foam twin mattress at Amazon.com (only two different twin XL versions), requiring me to look for a similar 12\" memory foam mattress with a merchant other than Sleep Shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the odor other reviewers have mentioned or complained about, I barely noticed it. I followed Sleep Shop's instructions when it arrived, and was able to sleep on the mattress that same night. However, during the shipping process, UPS was able to tear through the three layers of heavy duty plastic the mattress was shipped in, so any odor from the mattress was able to vent from the mattress prior to it being delivered. UPS did slightly abrade the soft cover on the mattress, but the mattress itself was not damaged. As for the abrasion on the cover, it was not significant enough for me to request a replacement. Be that as it may, Sleep Shop might want to add a couple more layers of heavy duty plastic or some other protective shipping material when shipping by UPS, because of the enormous headache it would have been to return the mattress, if it had been damaged in shipping. Fortunately, it was not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I strongly recommend this mattress, because of how soft and comfortable it is. For an even softer, more comfortable mattress, I would recommend going with Sleep Shop's 12\" Celebrity California King Pillow Top Memory Foam Mattress. It only costs slightly more than Sleep Shop's 12\" Deluxe California King Therapeutic w/5\" Memory Foam Mattress Bed with Dual AirFlow System. Either way, for the money, both are a good choice, and I doubt that you will be disappointed. Sleep well!\n",
      "I read many reviews before I finally decided to purchase this bed. I was very leery of internet mattresses. I was highly impressed and surprised. This bed is amazing and feels just like the tempurpedic i tried out at thee store. I have fallen inlove with this bed in just 2 nights. Amazing. It came all rolled up and vacuum sealed and my husband was like, \"woman what have you done\". I promised him it would reshape into a real mattress if given a few hours and we followed all the instructions, let it sit and he was very shocked to come back to a huge cal. King memory foam mattress. Love it, I would give it 8 stars if I could.\n",
      "My wife and I debated getting a new mattress for some time and after weeks of research and review, we decided to give this a try. We favored giving this a shot over the TempurPedic Rhapsody. So far we are pretty impressed and haven't complained once yet (in about 5 months). We originally tried using a previous box spring, but found that our box spring was also pretty beat up. Got the matching wood frame and it works perfectly. The unboxing was a bit difficult, but I was able to carry up a flight of stairs and unwrap myself. Even if this mattress only lasts 2-3 more years, it's still cheaper to buy a brand new one than putting down the ~$4000 for TempurPedic (Cal King). Overall were very satisfied and find this to be a great value.\n",
      "Good points:\n",
      "\n",
      "-Does a fair job keeping tea warm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bad points:\n",
      "\n",
      "-Large tea leaves get past the plunger.  Very poor filtering system.\n",
      "\n",
      "-Plunger does not work smooth requiring that you pay close attention when you push it down.\n",
      "\n",
      "-It is made out of plastic.  All the previous Bodum products I have purchases were glass.  I did not see the material listed on the Amazon page.\n",
      "\n",
      "-It will still leak, even when the top is fully closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "-The plunger does not go down far enough wasting a lot of tea.\n",
      "\n",
      "-I have purchased Bodum products in the past and they were European made and very good quality.  This was made in China and feels very cheaply made.\n",
      "\n",
      "-Stickers put by Bodum on the side and bottom of the container will not come off.  This is great if you want to read the \"directions\" and country of origin information for ever.  These stickers were put on crooked too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall:  Buy another product.  I would have given it 2 stars if it was so low cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE:  I decided to see how long this really keeps liquids \"hot\".  Unfortunately, not very long.  The tea seemed to go from \"too hot to drink\" to \"room temperature\" within minutes.  This was even after preheating the cup as suggested.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also spilled the cup, tea comes out so fast if you tip it with the lid closed, you can drink out of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I could drop this to 2 stars, I would.  Save your money!\n",
      "My husband and I have been sleeping on this mattress since November 2010. After letting it \"air out\" in our garage for a few nights we put it on our platform bed frame and began experiencing the very best nights sleep of our lives. When one of us gets in or out of the bed, there is no noticeable shift in the mattress. It stays cool in the summer and comfortably warm in the cooler nights. I have bad allergies to dust mites and have noticed a decrease in my allergy symptoms since sleeping on this wonderful bed. I highly recommend this to anyone wishing to \"sleep like a baby\" everynight. The price cannot be beat and the free shipping was fast.\n",
      "This is my second memory foam mattress from Dynasty. The 1st one was for my daughter and I decided to give it a try after waking up every morning with a sore back. Once again, very quick shipping and well packed. Took only 2 hours to completely expand and two days for the odor to disapate. I was looking forward to my 1st night sleep on it last night. At first it appeared very firm but softened I assume from my body heat. It was a very restful night sleep and I expect it to improve as my body gets use to it over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only negative; the very 1st time I touched the zipper to open the cover the latch broke off. Cheaply made in China! Otherwise I would have given 5 stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would highly recommend this seller.\n",
      "Who knew you could buy a rolled up mattress online sight unseen and want to tell everyone about it?!! This is a great product, and everything was flawless from order to delivery. It did have the slight chemical odor the first day but it wasn't noticeable after a day and it did take a couple days to get used to the mattress, but I'd order it again!\n",
      "This bed is absolutely worth EVERY penny. At first, I didn't think I liked it, but then I spent a weekend at a relatives, and sleeping on their regular spring mattress made me really realize how awesome this bed is. I have nothing bad to say about it. Love how big it is. Although trying to find Cali king sheets, and bed sets at local stores is VERY difficult, I wouldn't trade this bed for anything! I am going to buy a queen sized for my guest bedroom. Maybe even a twin for my son! If you're debating on whether or not to get this bed, seriously..put all questions aside and just GET IT! You won't regret it one bit!\n",
      "If you have back issues or are considering a memory foam mattress, LOOK NO FURTHER! You will not find another memory foam mattress with this level of memory foam (Weight and thickness) unless you spend 4X the $. A plain 2\"- 5lb. topper costs 50% what this mattress costs (Just run a search). While all memory foam retains heat and is originally supportive, it is not all the same. The lower the viscosity weight, the softer the foam, and the quicker it will soften. This is why a lesser weight memory mattress will need replacing in about 5 years while this should retain it's support for many more years.\n",
      " I'm very thin and love a soft bed or featherbed...but my back does not. So I have added a soft 2\" memory foam topper topped with a dense 1+1/2\" poly fill mattress pad . This omits the overheating issue, fully protects the mattress and pad and allows me to refresh + renew my sleeping surface with a simple washing. Not to forget it made this firm mattress like sleeping on a cloud without interfering the benefits of the memory foam.\n",
      " While I can't state the lifetime expectancy of this mattress, I am familiar with the various weights of memory foam and their differences, which is why I purchased this mattress. For this price, you can't go wrong and have a full warranty and trial period to insure you are as pleased with mattress as I am. p.s. Be aware, there is no white-glove delivery. You must remove your old mattress and set this up yourself.\n",
      "I read a lot of reviews, paying careful attention to the negative ones to see if they were legitimate or just a jaded customer on a fluke experience.  There were reviews that talked about the smell, the bed being too hot, the wrong item delivered, difficulty moving around on the bed, how heavy the bed was etc.  From our experience none of these have been true.  I'm 6'4'' 190 and my wife's 5'10'' 135.  We fit comfortably on the bed (in fact it's about an inch longer than our last Cal King).  We also live in AZ, and the bed has been slightly cooler than our pillow top.  We keep the house at 75 at night, and might even be able to up the thermostat a notch.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bed arrived rolled up in two layers of plastic measuring roughly 18 inches by 7 ft.  It unrolled easily onto our box springs and was fully matured (decompressed) in about 2-3 hours.  There was a  smell similar to getting new carpet or paint, though not nearly as strong.  After about a week, it's all but undetectable now.  It feels identical to the tempurpedics we tried out at the local store, and has been fantastic for reducing back aches and neck pain that my wife and I were getting after 6 years on a pillow top.  I can honestly say it's one of the best investments we've made so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it a heavy mattress?  Relatively speaking, it's the same if not lighter than our last mattress.  The one difficulty I can foresee is moving it when it comes time to pack up the house, as it does not have the internal support of a regular mattress.  It will likely roll up and wrap with a blanket and some ropes without much difficulty though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it hard to move around on?  I have no physical disabilities nor am I overweight, so I can't speak for those who are.  Other than that you shouldn't have a problem.  If you're worried, go try one out at a mattress store.\n",
      "\n",
      "How about delivery?  It was earlier than the ETA by about 3 days and was delivered right to our front door.  No complaints there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line:  It's a fantastic mattress for 1/3 to 1/4 the price of your conventional top of the line memory foam.  And the negative reviews?  Even the best YouTube videos get thumb downers occasionally.  It's bound to happen in an unmonitored online merchant rating system.  My endorsement would be to buy with confidence.\n",
      "I read the reviews and bought this anyway (not on Amazon btw) and am really, really disappointed. The first one had the press stuck in the bottom and I had to exchange it. I finally got all the stickers cleaned off the second one and tested it. Look, I know how to use a French Press coffee maker, I know what grind to use and how to use it. You still get grounds with this mug. I'm going to keep it but not to make coffee, just to keep the coffee hot after making it in something else. A nice travel mug; a lousy French Press!\n",
      "It's just as well mine was defective, because the product is worse than useless for travel as it's designed. The instructions say to \"stir\" in sugar and milk after you press, at which time, given the rod is there holding down the plunger,  you won't be able to use a spoon or in fact do anything more than wiggle a stir stick or a straw within the gap between the rod and the container wall. During this process, besides the sugar that you're liable to let fall all over the lid and around as you're dribbling or shoveling it in, a whole lot of what does makes it in will fall straight into one of the pie slice-shaped sectors on the upward face of the plunger, where there's even less wiggle room and the sugar grains would much rather settle in the mesh than be stirred. Wiggle too wildly, though, swish or invert the cup, and you will almost certainly allow coffee grounds into your drink. In the end, either a sugar or a coffee dregs awaits you at the bottom. Typically I decant, filter and microwave the coffee in another cup before drinking. A day or so later I clean up the mess, store the thing away and--sometimes too successfully alas--try to forget it ever happened. 30 day manufacturer warranty requires a receipt, you may want to note. Also, though advertised dishwasher safe, the seal between the inner and outer walls of the receptacle failed in one washing in mine--so that now it's just a sleek display case for the droplets, spots and rings that are trapped between them, like bugs in amber. This is guaranteed to happen by design, apparently, if and/or when the seal between the two walls fails, because the walls meet at a seam that runs right around the rim *inside the cup*. Way-to-go, Bodum. Do I sound bitter? So was the coffee.\n",
      "I purchased this tea/coffee maker to take with me to the office. The tea and coffee choices at the office are horrible and I thought this would be the perfect choice.\n",
      "The first couple of uses were fine, but as the plastic edges of the seal seemed to be used it got looser and pieces of loose tea would seep through.\n",
      "I would clean it right after my tea or coffee use but it still held on to the smells of whatever I made. I could never make tea after I made coffee after that or the tea tasted of stale coffee.\n",
      "\n",
      "In theory the cup is something that would be great to use, but it just felt cheap after a few uses.\n",
      "Love the idea of just dropping in your coffee grounds/loose tea, pouring hot water - and then leaving the house. So far, I can successfully filter coffee/tea about 1 of every 3 tries. The rest of the time, I'm drinking grounds/tea leaves. I wish the mouth had a mesh strainer (like our French press) - this takes care of any small bits that sneak out of the filter. Or I need to perfect my super-steady, super-slow pressing technique. But I'm not really the type of person who has that much patience - I mean I bought a to-go cup because I don't have time to drink at home!\n",
      "I've used this for 1+ years and I really like it. I typically brew a mug while I brush my teeth before heading into work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Best Practices:\n",
      "1. Add about 2 tablespoons of relatively coarse-ground coffee\n",
      "2. Fill 1/2 way with boiling water\n",
      "3. Stir vigorously for 10 seconds\n",
      "4. Fill to just under the threads on the neck\n",
      "4. Let sit for about 2 minutes\n",
      "5. Add sugar (optional)\n",
      "6. Stir for a few seconds\n",
      "7. Add cream/milk\n",
      "8. Screw on the top and slowly push the plunger all the way down\n",
      "I got this because my roommate for the summer didn't have a coffee maker. I didn't want to buy one, & thought this would be handy for making fresh refills at work or wherever. I was right. I used it all summer twice a day & no problem. It's best if you can coarse grind your coffee, but even the drip was not too bad if you pressed slowly & left room at the top. When I made a fresh one in the morning I poured half & half in the opening after I pressed. When I made the second cup at work, I put powdered creamer in with the coffee grounds. No problem either way. I didn't ever put a picture in. I think it's handy for it to be clear so I can see the grounds get pressed down & can go slow enough.\n",
      "I thought I might be able to brew tea on the road and have something from which to drink it as well. Although it is advertised as working like a french coffee press, it lets the tea leaves float up into the drinking area instead of being tucked under the press. I'm sure it would do the same with coffee\n",
      "This travel french press works fantastically as long as you remember not to let the water (and therefore the floating grounds or tea leaves) come above the line where the filter makes its seal.  Otherwise you end up with a mouthful of leaves or grounds for your first sip.  So a little tricky, but worth it for having fresh french press coffee at hand so quickly and easily.\n",
      "I bought this coffee press as a present.  The recipient has specifically asked for this product because it was reviewed as the best manual coffee press.  She is very happy with this press.\n",
      "Bought a bunch as gifts.. Many arrived broken and most friends said they lasted a month. Not a well made product.. Not great shipping either! No protective packing inside box at all!! Overall disappointed.\n",
      "We couldn't be happier with our purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "A huge thank-you to all the reviewers on this thread!\n",
      "\n",
      "We did our research and the remarks here not only helped us make a choice, but, we also knew in advance exactly how delivery and set-up would go. It was all smooth and simple.\n",
      "My only concern was the \"odor\" so many people mentioned as my nose is super sensitive. There was NO problem with odor at all.\n",
      "The very slight new product smell was gone by the time I put the sheets on the bed. Perhaps they have corrected this by now.\n",
      "The bed did completely expand within two hours, and was perfect by bed time.\n",
      "\n",
      "After sleeping on a Sarah Peyton memory foam mattress at my in-laws and finding that it \"cured\" my numb leg and foot problems(I was threatened with an MRI and possible back surgery!). I ordered their mattress when back home. After waiting more than two weeks for any kind of action on my order, I cancelled and choose this mattress. It arrived in three days! Free shipping too.\n",
      "\n",
      "This bed is much plusher than the SP bed, a fact which makes the hubby happy and turns out not to matter to my low back. Our chiropractor says the improvement to my numbness problem, as fixed by the bed, is probably all about pressure points. These mattresses are well know for relieving this. I can now attest to the truth of the claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had gone to a Sleep Number bed about 6 years ago and thought it was quite a nice bed. Not any more.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, a five star review, and highly recommended by a sufferer of Fibro Mialgia and advanced osteo-arthritis! Also, as purchased on Amazon, this is the least we have ever paid for a bed and one tenth the price of the bed Tempurpedic suggested we buy! How can it get any better than that?\n",
      "This was an impulse buy at Whole Foods a couple of months ago.  I am so sorry I didn't come to Amazon ahead of time to read these reviews; I would have saved myself $20.  This Coffee Press STINKS!!  I use it on a medium grind coffee, and have tons of coffee grounds in my cup of coffee EVERYDAY.  I hate it!  I have tried every different way of plunging I can think of, but grounds still escape the filter.  I don't even drink out of the plastic cup.  I add the coffee grounds, then the water, let it steep and then pour it into a regular coffee mug.  I then scrap out as many \"floaters\" as I can manage and still end up with a cup full of coffee grinds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very poor design execution.  Please save your money.\n",
      "I had one of these for about 6 months until, I lost it in the library - it was not in the lost and found, so someone else must have liked it too. It was a great purchase, really saves money on buying coffee out, as long as you have grounds and can get hot water, you have a good way to make coffee or tea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dan's comments are very valid. But, I removed my sticker right away afer i received it and did not have problems Also if you leave the lid closed it will stay hot for about an hour, which is generally long enough. I have found too that some teas work better than others in it. It also does get some condensation in-between layers - i thought this might be solved by getting the version that does not let you put a picture in it - but it still does.\n",
      "This is definitely the worst french press I've ever used. There are no handles, and the plastic gets too hot to hold, so you have to awkwardly pour by the top. The normal un-screwing of the top can also unscrew the bottom part of the plunger, which is then very hard to get out. For reasons I can't explain, the same coffee in the same sized press tastes significantly worse from this press when compared to my normal glass Bodum press. But the worst part is that plenty of grinds manage to squeeze around the edges of the plunger and end up in your coffee, no matter how careful you are.\n",
      "\n",
      "Basically the only good thing about this press is that it is made from plastic and is very durable. You can just toss it in your bag (or bring it camping) and not have to worry about it. Mine was a returned item, so I got it for $5, which is about how much this thing is worth. Every other press I've ever used works  better, but at least this won't break.\n",
      "I got this mug at Target because I drink a lot of loose-leaf tea, I mostly was drawn to it for its double-walled construction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The seal for the 'plunger' strainer is not tight enough, and only the chunkiest/largest leaves will stay at the bottom\n",
      "\n",
      "The plunger doesn't go all the way down.. so what am I supposed to do... put 2\" of tea leaves in there?  Don't try green or white tea since they are so sensitive to heat and grow bitter the longer they steep.. you have no way to get them out once the steeping time has passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lid... oh yeah. The lid leaks, don't think about holding it upside down or even tilting it to the side with the cap closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "To sum it up:  DON'T BOTHER BUYING THIS.  I'm really disappointed in Bodum, I have some of their mugs/tea pots.. but this is a sophomoric effort at best.\n",
      "I bought this cup at a local high-end cookware store for $10 so I could avoid shipping. I have a Bodum French Press at home for use with fair-trade organic roasts. I'm often work long nights away from home and need coffee to stay alert. I'm not a fan of the coffee at work, and I was hoping I could make my own. Not with this cup, and here's why.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Grounds get past the plunger. A lot of grounds, every time. The plastic/silicone seal on the plunger is too soft and does not effectively do the job. I grind my own coffee and grind size does not seem to make a difference. The coarsest grind still escapes.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The sealing method on the cup \"spout\" is worthless, and I need a leakproof mug. This leaks even when securely snapped.  When opened, the cover does not snap down, and hits me in the nose every time I take a sip. Just annoying, yes, but enough so that I feel it needs mentioning.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The only way to get cream/sugar in the cup after pressing the coffee is through the spout, which is just smaller than a regular teaspoon.  This makes it really hard to adjust the coffee the way I like it.\n",
      "\n",
      "- My coffee does not stay hot for very long in this cup. Since it has metal parts, I can't just reheat it and I hate to waste good coffee.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, this was a waste of $10. I'll still continue to use Bodum products, but I won't be buying any more travel cups. Good idea, poorly executed.\n",
      "The biggest problem I have with this product is that the plunger doesn't fit snugly enough to the sides of the cup, which means there's a fair amount of coffee grounds still swirling around.  However, the double-walled cup is awesome in keeping the drink hot for quite awhile.\n",
      "Pros: The is the perfect size to make one cup at a time.  Dishwasher safe and plastic means easy to clean and durable enough to take on the road (or trail).  The included directions are clear and concise.  Low price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:  The seal at the edge of the filter is just a silicone wiper seal (sort of like a squeegee), and does not seal with enough authority to keep all grounds from slipping past, though only a couple and with a little bit of practice, even less.  The instructions suggest adding any cream and sugar through the opening in the lid, which is way to small for the task, at least without making a mess. You would be better off to pour your brew into another mug and doing your mixing there.  Additionally, unless you pour your tea into another mug, this is not a great choice, as the press would merely hold the leaves down and not stop the steeping process.  If you need this for home/office use, you are better off with a glass model (such as one from their Chambord line&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Bodum-Chambord-12-Cup-6-US-cups-Coffee-Press/dp/B00005LM0T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bodum Chambord 12-Cup (6 US cups) Coffee Press</a>) which has a better filter/seal system and larger capacity.\n",
      "I got it for tea. And it doesn't keep the tea leaves down on the other hand, all the water trapped bellow the net doesn't spill.... so it's fine enough to keep water down, but still lets tea leaves through? I'd love a physics person to explain it to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "PROS: Super insulated nice spout, and can use without the cover feels like a glass.\n",
      "This is a great product but it as other reviewers mentioned there are some small drawbacks. HOWEVER, in my opinion this is still a great product.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The plunger doesn't go all of the way down. I think they did this in order to make sure the plunger will fit down in the lid no matter how much coffee grounds or tea leaves you have in the mug.\n",
      "- The seal on the plunger isn't perfect - you'll need to press down slowly instead of just pushing the plunger as fast as you can.\n",
      "- It is close to a perfect seal but if you hold it upside down it will drip drip drip. For most purposes this is fine but I've got some OXO travel mugs that create a perfect seal (though they don't double as a coffee press.)\n",

      "1) Boil water in another container either in the microwave or on the stove.\n",
      "2) Add grounds for about 1.5 servings. If you ground your own beans go for a courser grind instead of a fine powder here. I also go ahead and add any sugar and cream I want before adding the water. This resolves some of the problems other reviewers were having with trying to add these after pressing the grounds.\n",
      "3) I add enough boiling water to cover the grounds and wait a few seconds. Sometimes I swirl it a bit to make sure the sugar dissolves at this point. Then I go ahead and add the remaining boiling water.\n",
      "4) Close the lid and wait about 3 minutes for the coffee to brew. More for even darker and less for a lighter brew. You'll probably need to experiment a little to get the coffee brewed to your liking (I basically made some good tasting espresso my first time with too many grounds and too long on the brewing time.)\n",
      "5) SLOWLY press down the plunger. As with most press pots you may have a few grounds sneak through and also if your grounds are too fine they may go through the filter and into the coffee you'll drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm really happy with this - it brews my coffee better than my existing coffee maker so I've been using this and making one cup coffee for myself every couple of days or so for the last two weeks. For about $10 it's a great deal.\n",

      "I gave this glass 3 stars only because it was chipped and I had to return it. I will however buy a set of four, it's a beautiful heavy glass! Be careful and read description because looking at picture I thought it was a set of 4 glasses. However, when I opened the box and saw just one glass, as soon as I picked it up and felt it's weight I understood why only one glass for this price. I would definitely recommend this product and will purchase a set of four myself\n",
      "This pattern was discontinued decades ago, however, this glass was a close match. I wanted the smaller size to replace two that had disappeared. I ended up buying six of these. The glass is a bit thicker and not so delicate but great heft in the hand and lots of sparkle.\n",
      "I chipped 2 of my best loved DOF and needed to replace them.  Couldn't remember the maker or pattern name.  After a lot of research, took the plunge on these.  They are absolutely beautifully brilliant.  Each glass weighs over a pound and sparkles.  Appropriate for company cocktails & dinner.  They are so beautiful, I am buying more.\n",

So I thought I'd try this one out, and it works perfectly.  I like that is is clear, and it is pretty heavy duty.\n",
      "Love it! Good quality\n",
      "This expandable kitchen drawer works great.  After having my kitchen remodeled I bought this instead of a wooden one I used to have in one of my drawers.  This didn't break like the bamboo one I used to have and it's nice because you can wash these and put them back in the drawer, which is not possible with the wood ones.  Overall I would buy this again.\n",

      "This holds large and small kitchen knives, up to about 8.5\" blades. It will hold eight of them, even if they have thick handles; my large and small Pioneer Woman knives sit side by side and the handles don't touch. The slots won't accommodate knife sheaths, but with the holder you won't need them anymore.\n",

      "This fit my kitchen drawers perfectly!! It could have been a little longer, but we're very happy. I spent a while looking for nice simple plain, easy to clean dividers, and this works great.\n",
      "This product helped me to reduce the amount of clutter in my flatware drawer.  There are no loose utensils, which makes it easier to grab what you need.  Love this product.\n",
      "I really like these.  At first I bought one just to see if I like it and it fit well within my drawer.  I liked it so much I bought three more.  Very organized now!\n",

      "Just recently, however, my favorite cottage cheese has become unavailable locally so I've returned to making fresh cheese again.  Yesterday, using the recipe printed in the pamphlet inside the Junket box, I made my first batch of cottage cheese in years and it is as good as I remembered--dense, tangy and creamy all at once.  The commercial cottage cheese that I had  been buying was fine but the cheese that I made from Junket's recipe was so far superior and so simple that to me it's absolutely worth the effort.  And besides the cottage cheese, I'm looking forward to trying out some other recipes from the Junket pamphlet too.\n",

      "As expected.\n",

      "Have several. We are organizational freaks and these are great. Very sturdy.\n",
      "This is great at organizing all of the utensils in a kitchen and it holds a lot! Its long enough to hold almost all of the utensils and its only a few that are too long that I have. But I use this to keep tools I don't use as often. My main tools are in a Utensil caddy n the kitchen counter Before having this organizer I had Utensils scattered all over though. This organizer is very durable as well so its a nice thickness to it. And as with ALL InterDesign products it has the annoying stickers all over it that are hard as heck to get off!!! They often require using Gum Out to get the remainder off.\n",

All you need is a gallon of milk, junket tablets and citric acid. Its so simple and the taste of fresh mozzarella is much better than store bought. This is such a great product, I will be purchasing again!\n",
      "worked good with the recipes that came with it.\n",

      "We use this in our bathroom for toothbrushes, toothpaste, and other small items. It is sturdy and didn't come with any cracks. My only wish is that it was dishwasher safe. All of our drawer organizers end up needing a good cleaning after a long period of time.\n",
      "I recently tried making home made mozzarella with Junket rennet and it turned out way better that I had hoped. I would reomment this to others who are willing tor try. My mom used to make the pudding for us when we were little. This is hard to find in the grocery store. Glad I could find it online.\n",
      "Didn't work.  I bought liquid rennet at the same time and the liquid rennet worked instantly.\n",
      "Excellent product but labels are too difficult to remove.\n",
      "I personally think this organizer was way too much: $14 -- but it was exactly the size I needed so it's now mine.  I am impressed with the quality of the plastic.  Price hurts but it works and the plastic thickness makes it seem durable.\n",
      "I bought this while on a recent organizing kick. The top drawer in our bathroom cabinet had become a catch-all for junk and I wanted to make it easier to find what I needed without pulling everything out. This worked beautifully!\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a sturdy clear plastic with two small compartments, one medium compartment, and one large compartment. I use the medium and small sections for band-aids, hairpins, and other tiny objects that always end up in the bathroom drawer. The larger section holds toothpaste, a dental mirror, and other larger items. Now I can see everything at a glance! It's amazing. There is even a little room left over in the drawer.\n",

      "Five stars and highly recommended for anyone who wants to organize their junk drawer, whether it's in the kitchen, bathroom, or anywhere.\n",
      "I bought this to organize the junk drawer in my kitchen and it's just perfect! It keeps everything in place and makes it easier to find things now. I looked around and this price can't be beat, especially since it's so sturdy. I highly recommend it!\n",
      "In an effort to get my house organized, I bought this for my side of the bathroom. It helped me organize the drawers. It fit perfectly into the vanity drawer and I could find things easily.  Also it allowed me to fit more items in the drawer. It was a great price and arrived quickly.\n",
      "Fits my weird size desk drawer perfectly and is a nice quality.  Overall gave it 4 stars only because i feel for a plastic product it is overpriced.\n",
      "I bought this to make cheese with.  Works great.\n",
      "Bought this for mozzarella....after deep sixing 3 gallons of milk, I decided this is garbage.  The cheese does not curdle....best you get is what appears to be ricotta until you try to strain it.\n",
      "Good for ice cream not cheese\n",
      "It's ok. I am learning to make cheese and saw that this was supposed to work. It does but perhaps not as good as the rennet. I will use this if I can't get rennet.\n",

      "I like it!\n",
      "I have an African Jungle them in my bathroom and this works wonderfully as for decor.  I have received many compliments.\n",
      "This is a really very good quality item. Can't say overly much about it. Straightforward. Thick plastic, well finished, smooth.\n",
      "Exactly what I needed to hold some of my desk supplies.  I have a laptop so it fits perfectly in my desk where the keyboard would be.  good price too!\n",
      "Looks smarter than the typical white storage trays.  I actually bought this for a bathroom vanity and it works great.\n",
      "I love this stuff. It is really hard to find here so I ordered it. It makes a wonderful \"custard\" like dish from warm milk and vanilla. I have thoughts of making my own cottage cheese with it as it has a recipe for that, or at least it used to. Will have to check. Have used this product for over 40 years.\n",
      "Ok\n",

      "I follow an organizing blog and one of her tricks is to use clear drawer dividers/holders and fancy papers/shelf liners underneath to keep you motivated to stay organized. I thought the best place to do this would be my kitchen, so I bought clear trays and organizers for all my drawers that needed them, as well as fun shelf liner.\n",
      "\n",
      "This has been an excellent purchase, the cutlery tray is really nice quality. It feels like very thick material, unlike the trays from Walmart, Target, etc. It has tiny feet to keep it slightly off the bottom of the drawer, and fits all of the items I need it to fit.\n",

      "Easy to use, great price.\n",

      "I have bought several variations in the last month. All are very well made with robust plastic and effective rubber nodes (feet) to keep them in place. I highly recommend spending the few extra dollars, they are worth it.\n",
      "THIS IS A DECENT PRODUCT, BUT IT HAS IT'S SHORTCOMINGS.  IT DOES NOT CONTACT THE BOTTOM OF THE DRAWER VERY WELL, THEREFORE ALLOWING THINGS TO SLIDE UNDER.  UNDOUBTEDLY THERE ARE BETTER PRODUCTS AROUND. IT DID ARRIVE ON TIME.\n",

      "I had a yearning for Junket, so I located this product which is required to make it, on-line. It arrived quickly and I am very happy with the company that sent it.\n",
      "I placed an order for 1 box of Junket Rennet tablets on July 9th and received it yesterday (July 16th).  In the meantime, I visited the manufacturer's website and placed and additional order for 6 boxes of rennet (each box at less than half the price of the box I ordered here) on July 11th and received it on July 14th.  Incredibly slow shipping in my opinion, and my one tiny box of rennet arrived in a box intended for an entire case of the product filled the rest of the way with paper, which was a waste of packaging and environmentally unfriendly.  In the future, I'll just order directly from Junket.\n",
      "So far I have made three attempts at making mozzarella.  The first time was using the rennet in a kit and it worked as per the description. The next two attempts I used this brand of rennet. Both times I had to let it sit for a very long time, both times I added more rennet  and both times I got a separation but the curds were very small and on the bottom.  I strained them out but lost a bit as some of the pieces were so small that they went through the strainer until I got a yogurt strainer.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not sure why they did not work but I was using raw milk both times so it was not the result of processing. The end product was very good and even though it did not work as advertised I still ended up with mozzarella that is way better than any you might buy in the store.  I just wonder if I am getting as much end product as I would with say an animal rennet made for cheese making.  I follow the directions on the kit so I do not think that the failure is a product of not doing it right but since others have had good success I cannot rule that out.  Oh my two failures also used two methods to add some acid to the milk.  I used Citric Acid one time and yogurt and buttermilk the other time.  Each method produced similar results.\n",
      "I don't know if this review is for the Junkets or for the seller. These tablets do not work for me. I have tried with different milks, I added calcium to the milk, I inoculated one hour before, I inoculated and renneted overnight. All around, impossible to obtain a clean break the way Fankhauser describes. I gave up on junkets, and I ordered Austrian Bio Ren and Fromasin, also from Europe. Maybe this is a bad batch, the box is stamped 12 08 - it is now sept 2011-and I do not know what that means. Gave 2 stars since includes a nice booklet with recipes, but these Junkets are junk.\n",
      "I use my rennet tablets to make cheese, and they have preformed perfectly every time. It takes about 20 minutes longer for the curds to separate from the whey when using these tablets vs animal rennet. I store the rennet tablets in my freezer (longer shelf life).\n",

      "OK, we had an Alum. Christmas tree that was sold back in the 1960's that belonged to a my mom, so we knew what to expect from a retro Alum. Christmas Tree. If you have never owned an Alum. tree, or know little about how they are made, you may not like it. I had put my mom's together many times and decorated it. This will be our daughter first Christmas in her own apartment and she wanted to use the Alum. tree, so we gave it to her. When we saw this slim line design retro alum. tree at Amazon we decided that would be nice to have, and it would fit nicely beside our fireplace, so we ordered it. The tree is as to be expected for a retro alum. Christmas tree. We love it! It appears to be made just like my mom's tree, but not as wide and that is a good thing for us.\n",
      "Can't wait for Christmas to put it up but looks fun\n",
      "The product was incomplete , it came with 2 bottom poles, and the seller is saying I'm sorry to a refund.... I bought it in good faith in July and had faith that it was all correct, I didn't need it until now and just discovered it was incomplete, and can't be used at all.....so because I didn't get right back to them , I'm out a lot of money and their not standing behind the merchandise .\n",

      "This tree looks very nice once you get it put up. Mine had zero instructions so I had to wing it, and i found a few of the holes on the pole needed drilled out larger to get the branches in. Bottom line is I'm glad I bought it.\n",
      "I found this product on amazon.com and bought through the brandsonsale website because I was ordering color wheels to go along with it and wanted to save on shipping. What came to me was a piece of crap. The base was cracked. The pole in the middle was wood with a shoddy paint job. Many of the limbs took forever to try to put them in. This is worth no more than $30. It just looks like crap.\n",

      "the rings break easily, and there's only one pair of 3 sizes so you're s.o.l. when they break. the suction bulbs could use a little stronger suction to help get things into \"the ready position\". sometimes the rings would roll themselves off, especially if the skin was wet, and obviously when the skin relaxed.\n",
      "nice set....I was glad to see it was made of hard plastic.....I got a set from another seller and the suction tubes were glass and I put them in my pocket and one broke not very happy\n",
      "I bought these after a friend recommended. It is such a great idea for any women wishing temporary larger nipples. It comes with two sizes, and the small black bands for each size. A little tricky to use at first, but with some practice they are great. I do not recommend for more than an hour. After wearing them for a few hours, my nipples hurt after I took them off. They didn't hurt while wearing them because I think they were numb by then.\n",
      "This works exactly as I had hoped for. Bought two sets to have a regular and larger set, rather than one of each size. The rings come in various sizes and work great.\n",
      "For some reason the cubical walls in my office are extremely wide, like four inches or more. :/  This item works with that configuration, but it is too narrow, looks a bit off when installed, and a lot of times the hook comes off when I remove my coat.  No problem to just put it back on, but I would have preferred something that fit better.  It does work, however, and I've had many of my office mates ask me about where I purchased it. :)\n",
      "This works very well in the cubical I have at work. Its not real heavy dudy but it does just fine holding a winter coat so its good enough for me.\n",
      "Does the job. It fits my cubicle and I can use it to hang stuff. I haven't tried anything particularly heavy.\n",
      "This may fit over some office patrician, but won't fit over any cubicle wall on say a an office floor.  Look for something more sturdy and and measure your wall before you purchase.  This is definitely not heavy duty enough to hold my backpack with out the laptop in it.\n",
      "Simple design, looks kind of like an 'S'. One hook goes over the door, and then other forms the hook you hang your things on. The hooks are two different sizes, so you can turn it over. One thing to note is that both hook sizes are pretty big. Bigger than a standard indoor door. Makes sense for cubicles - a lot of cubicle walls are thicker than a standard door too.\n",
      "My only complaint is that the hook is narrow and not rounded. I use it for towels, and things with hang-loops/handles... but if I throw a shirt over it, the shirt becomes deformed where the hook pokes it. The rubber tip prevents damage but not deforming.\n",
      "Product looks better than on a picture. It has hook on both sides, so it would fit to different types of walls. You can actually bend it a little, so it fits tight to cubicle wall. One of my co-workers bought different hook and it didn't snap as tight as this one.\n",
      "These are beautifully made or quality metal and work well with hats of all kinds.  We hung ours on the backs of closet doors.\n",
      "Not much you can say about a coat hook, but I will say that I was impressed with the weight of this item when I received it. Not your ordinary cheaply manufactured coat hook, this one was solid, perfectly polished and came with all the necessary hanging screws, etc. Well worth the cost.\n",
      "We have a stainless steel kitchen cart in our kitchen.  I wanted a hook to hang our canvas grocery bags on so they'd be in one place off the floor.  This is just the ticket.  It looks sleek, and the magnet is quite strong.  It does on occasion fall down if there are too many bags or someone bumps into it, but overall I'm quite pleased.  I like that the hook part swivels as well.\n",
      "The problem I had with this is that the hook is not fixed. It swivels, which takes time to hang anything.\n",
      "It looks great and hopefully will serve for the purpose I got this product\n",
      "Really works well and is nicely made.  great for the fridge so I can throw a towel on it.\n",

      "Just returned from a camping trip. This soap caddy is handy for camping and the gym. Means you don't ahve to worry about dropping teh soap or putting it down in public, potentially germy pools of water. I plan on buying a second one for my boyfriend. Buy it! You won't regret it!\n",
      "Used this on the side of the fridge to hold my lunch box. Works great and have good strength.\n",
      "(wife replying) I used to put a dish towel on the refrigerator handle and another one on the stove handle. Then I got a dog that loved to steal the towels and run around the house dragging them on the floor. I needed to come up with a way to put the towels up without her being able to reach them. This worked for me, I ordered 2 of them. I attached them to the upper portion of my refrigerator door and just hooked the towels over them. It hasn't scratched the frig and the dog can't reach it. So that is a Win-Win.\n",
      "I have been looking at many coat hooks to mount on the wall next to our back door to hang my gardening hat. I was having serious issues finding one that blended the other decorations trying to figure out how to mount it in a limited space. As soon as I saw this, I knew my problem was solved. Our refrigerator is near or back door and has about 8\" of clearance to the doorway. Works perfect and blending with wall decorations issue is gone!\n",
      "Wonderful little hook\n",
      "I have a TINY kitchen and where to hang the towel has always been a problem. Now it hangs on the fridge at the perfect height of  my choosing. Kinda wish it didn't swivel but my son likes that feature. Sturdy too!\n",
      "Excellent\n",
      "I stuck this on the fridge to use as a hand towel holder. Rushing to clean up a spill, I grabbed the towel, and the magnet came with it and shattered when it hit the floor.\n",
      "Sturdy, but does not hold much weight.  Good for a lightweight jacket.  I used it to hold up my headphone set.  It worked fine for that.\n",
      "Very strong magnet but the plastic black thing on the end is troublesome.  My towel just kept hanging up on it, so I pulled it off and use it without; however it is sort of sharp on the end now.  I also put some super glue in the hole where the hook is inserted into the magnet because the hook swiveled from side to side and was difficult to put a towel on it.  This worked and now the hook stays stationary.\n",
      "great product\n",
      "I always need a hook to hang things up on , you can almost put one of these any place there is metal .\n",

      "Great little magnets to hold my dishtowels on the side of my refrigerator.  Happy with my purchase.\n",
      "Nice looking, sturdy magnetic hook to hang our towel on our refrigerator.  Did not have a good place for a screwed-in towel ring, so this does the job.  Like the fact that the arm swings too.\n",
      "Not the toughest magnets but will hold up a beach towel\n",
      "Very strong magnet.  Items and magnet do not slide.  It stays in place.\n",
      "Much bigger than I thought! (I originally ordered this to use for keys---no way was that going to work). Magnet is strong but definitely put it on a flat magnetic surface. Bumpiness definitely seemed to reduce the effectiveness of the magnet (I use it for 1 scarf and I wouldn't dare put more on).\n",
      "If you have some of the KOA caddys from long ago, these are very similar but half the quality.  But they hold your soap, and you can hang them on the campground shower faucet, so they do the job.\n",
      "hard to find.  we remember it from long ago camping trips and wanted it again.  works fine\n",
      "Needed this for my shower sessions at work.\n",
      "\n",

      "This was a bit pricey for the material, but it is exactly what I needed. I'm satisfied.\n",
      "I love this.  I was trying to replace my old soap caddies from the ones I bought at KOA years ago.  They broke because they were so old.  These don't say KOA but no big deal.  They work and are perfect when you are in the campground showers.\n",
      "Exactly as advertised, strong enough to hold a towel on the refrigerator, suits our needs exactly.\n",
      "This thing sticks! No other magnets stick to my fridge but this one sure does!\n",
      "Magnet not as strong as advertised.\n",
      "Purchased in June of 2016 plastic has cracked, no abuse\n",
      "Good product.\n",
      "Great for camping!  Still using years later\n",
      "The top cover does not close securely. It falls all the time.\n",

      "I do not recommend it.\n",
      "I have it on my refrigerator  with a towel in it. It is big but very strong holding.\n",
      "Strong magnet, great hook. Have one of those small stackable washer/dryers, so am using these on the front of the dryer to hold detergent packs\n",
      "I've been using this to hold a heavy hand towel on my refrigerator and it works very well. The only issue I have with it is that the hook swings back and forth very easily, so even though I keep pushing it so that's it's parallel to the fridge it will swing back out any time I use the towel. No big deal, it just doesn't make the swing feature particularly useful.\n",
      "Works as advertised.\n",
      "Works perfect to hang a dish towel from the fridge. well made and looks nice too.\n",
      "works great. perfect for even really wide bars of homemade soap. Boy scout used it for 3 different summer camps\n",
      "I love the convenience of the rope and closure system as well as the drain holes in the bottom. I travel to a lot of bike runs with dirty showers and this caddy makes being clean a little easier.\n",
      "Works great for camping, hard to find locally.\n",
      "I really appreciate this product. When I am away from home my toiletries are the hardest thing to organize. If you do not have a lot of space and you want to let your soap dry off to make it last longer these are great. I use one for my soap bar and another for a rag. Just wring out the rang and there you have it. There are about 3 or 6 hole in the bottom to allow air flow. The top is not secure so don't expect any type of \"snap\" when you push it on to the bottom portion. I would use this over one of the small travel soap containers any day.\n",
      "Hard to mess up this design. Simple and it works.\n",
      "Perfect for my husband to keep soap in at work and carry it back and forth to our gym there.\n",
      "Very useful in my tiny shower\n",
      "This does its job, which is keeping me from dropping the soap, (insert joke here) I would have given this another star if the lid closed tigher\n",
      "This is a nice product, just wish the top design was different.\n",
      "Perfect for traveling\n",
      "This is really helpful if you are disabled and need to shower seated. This can loop over the handicap rail to hold the soap bar. I have found it very helpful.\n",
      "I bought this to bring on a camping trip. It works well and prevents you from putting the soap down in unknown places.\n",
      "I ordered this to travel with. The first thing I noticed is that there are holes in the bottom for drainage. This eliminates me traveling with it now since it will leak all over everything. That aside, the lid doesn't stay on at all. The plastic is so cheap and flimsy. The only use i can see for this is if you just leave it hanging in the shower....and that might be what everyone is doing.\n",
      "At first I was a little skeptical as we have a lot of hardwood..even for kindling..starts very good and lasts at least 15 minutes per piece..good value..beats the liquid goo...\n",
      "After years of using almost every type of firestarter, discovered the Nuggets and they perform as advertised plus they claim to be enviro-friendly.  May be but all I know is that they do the thing - no paper (other than to heat the flue) - logs catch within 5 - 10 minutes.  Nice to find something that actually meets the claims of the manufacturer.\n",
      "These work very well for dry material and OK for somewhat wet.  They can be a little problematical in wind but over all are one of the best starters I have tried and also one of the cheapest.\n",
      "\n",
      "BTW you usually need to strike 2 matches together or use a lighter to get these going.  Particularly if it is cold; 0F or lower.\n",
      "\n",
      "BTW I just noticed that the price has  gone up by nearly 10x from the $24 I paid.  I can not recommend them at that $189 price.  There are lots and lots of better cheaper alternates.  Well they are now back down in price.  I don't know if the ridiculous price was an error or aberration.\n",
      "I like that they're more natural but I find I do need a handful of them to get a fire started. But they work well.\n",
      "Its ok, takes a bit of time to get the nugget to catch fire but it does the job.\n",
      "Excellent product.\n",
      "Loved these!! Far support to the flat cardboard type I purchased earlier in the season\n",
      "Survive the Wyoming Winter no problem - with the help of these. I have to chop up about half the amount of kindling when I use these which is such a time saver. LOVE these! 1 and 1/2 box lasted the entire winter.\n",
      "I was hoping to like these but what I saved on the item price, I spend in lighter fluid to attempt and get them lit. I do like them, they are just such a pain to light. I probably would not buy these again, and would go back to the kind I get from Wal-Mart. Although, they do get the fire started nicely. They just take to long to catch in the first place.\n",
      "I try to never run out of these\n",
      "Easiest way to get a fire started.\n",
      "super easy to use and get fire going in wood stove. works awesome wish i had used these a long time ago. no more kindling put these in under log with some cardboard next to them light card board and it lights the logs on fire\n",
      "I had one of these hooks years ago, but when my daughter moved into her own home, she liked it so much that I gave it to her. I've been looking ever since for a replacement,and finally found it. This Hinge-it Hook is even better than the original, because it has a double hook. I bought four of them and put them on doors all over the house. They are very simple to install--takes about 5 minutes to do--and they work much better than over the door hooks, because they don't interfere with opening and closing the door at all. I'm very happy with this product.\n",
      "Ok, let me admit that I have not been able to make this product work, through no fault of the Hinge-It, because my darn apt door hinges are rusted or painted together.  I can't get the pin out.\n",
      "\n",
      "That being said, I keep eyeing that space behind my bathroom door (wasted!) and thinking about what I could put there.  This is a great space-saver, especially for people in small-footprint apartments.  Looks very nice, too, with its clean elegant lines and rounded-oval ends.  Shipped super quickly.\n",
      "Hard to catch fire, but once the light they last a while. I am going to look for new options for next year as these were a bit frustrating to use. Also, the box is FULL of sawdust and was a mess to open.\n",
      "Works fantastic. I've actually cut them in half. Can be hard to light them though but does make it much easier to light my fireplace instead of paper.\n",
      "no more struggle to get the fire or charcoal started.  Use them every night\n",
      "I have tried other fire starter aids that were just ok. For some products, I had to use several pieces to get the flames started. These have worked best for me. I never needed more than 1 or 2 to get the fire going. I will never go back to another brand. These are, by far, the best I've seen.\n",
      "Work great in our wood stove and BBQ.\n",
      "Very hard to light. Kept inside in a plastic tote to insure dryness but still very difficult to light. Will not buy again\n",
      "work great\n",
      "This works just fine for me.  I use two to help me get that wood stove going.  Gets the kindling started in no time without having use a lot of paper products.  One problem for me is that these little dome shaped starters can loose some of it's fibrous material.  So I double boxed it and am careful when carrying them when needed.  I've used other brands of starters and they have the same slight crumbly composition too.  I like that each one is a good size and not a huge piece that needs to be broken into smaller sections.\n",
      "Works as advertised.  Great product.\n",
      "Good product.. swivels, and I use it to hang my bike helmet on the bike rack.  Very strong magnet.. Lots of potential uses.\n",
      "Made starting campfires a real breeze.  Worked really well with charcoal bbq as well. Was easy to light and worked as advertised.  I would order again.\n",
      "Works like a charm...\n",
      "Weve used these for years.  So happy to find them on Amazon.  They work great every time!\n",
      "Does not work. Much better fire starters can be purchased.\n",
      "These are a bit hard to light, but other than that they work well in my wood stove\n",
      "Ok for starting kindling, not so good for starting logs. It's not a huge flame, and even 3-4 of them together weren't enough to do more than singe a small log. They were also far more difficult to light than I expected them to be. I had to hold the lighter on them for a good 15-20s to get it to finally catch, and at that point, I probably could have started the fire by just holding the lighter to the kindling.\n",
      "Works, but slides around a lot.\n",
      "Bought these for a small (and I mean small) locker at work that only had 1 hanger.  The magnet on these is very strong so should do nicely!\n",
      "Did not realize it swivels when I bought it and thought at first it was broken.  I've decided it's better that way, so no problem.\n",
      "This magnet is made well and strong! Hold excellent! Just in the huge earthquake and while everything fell and my fridge moved.. This didn't budge!! :)\n",
      "Easy to start your Fire Pit Fires.\n",
      "THese things are terrible if you have a npn-conventional rack. My rack is 1 and 1/8th inch from the floor and I will be lucky if I get 20 lights out of the hbo0x with9uot the additiomal use 0of kindling which pretty much defeats thevpurpoose. Very disappointed won't be buying again.\n",
      "I'm going to be on my third box of these with the winter we had.  They are great!\n",
      "Surprisingly useful. We put this on our door as a curtain holdback. We like that it rests flat when not in use.\n",
      "The rubber tip is great at holding towels, they don't slip easily.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't stand the swivel!  I always have to use two hands to hang the towels, which I'm almost always doing while holding something else, awkward.\n",
      "These hooks are much larger and stronger than I expected.  Adhere very well to side of fridge or W/D.  Will order more.\n",
      "I love this product. Strong hold a great amount of weight.  I use this product on my stainless steel countertop walls to hold tongs, stainless steel measuring cups and in kitchen towels. I wish I could post a pic..  There is a swivel to the hook which I prefer but can potentially be a bother to others..but not me!  Overall super happy it's a win-win and two thumbs up for me.\n",
      "I installed them in our metal storm shelter, They hold a lot of weight and are handy to have. Good product.  Quick delivery.\n",
      "Great product.  Suggest opening the box over a waste can, there is some surface shedding in transit.\n",
      "Work great\n",
      "purchased these for my mom, she thinks there great\n",
      "Exellent choise\n",
      "This is a good hook, attaches strong to the wall.  Much bigger than I expected.  The disk is about the size of a cherry jar lid. The hook is much too big for hanging a normal key ring, which is why I bought them, but I have found other uses.\n",
      "Amazing,  love this little hook! Keeps the towel off the counter.  Does slide down a bit but looks good. I love it.\n",
      "The hook is VERY big. You can't tell exactly what size this is from the online info.  It was way too big for my purpose.  Besides that, the weld that holds the hook in place was broken, and the hook was swiveling freely in the magnetic base. Not too helpful.  Didn't want to waste the money to return it, so in the trash it went.\n",
      "I use this on the refrigerator and on the dishwasher to hang dish towels.  PERFECT!  It is large but does not stick out far because it swings to the side on its own.\n",
      "the magnet is surprisingly strong and bigger than i expected.  i have mine hanging on the fridge and it holds up a dish towel and 3 oven mits. doesn't slide at all! also, the hook swivels which was an unexpected plus!\n",
      "Heavy duty and easily holds two heavy pot holders and/or mitts.  Hook does stick out as mentioned in the description.  Also folds to the side, but I can't get it stay in the side position. H\n",
      "Small but Burns a long time !\n",
      "NOT fire starters - fire ENHANCERS. These do not light well unless you scratch off the wax layer coating the tablets. (These are round mounds, not sticks.) But once lit they stay lit for a long time, burn hot and really help move cold air out of the chimney. Just difficult to light.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I will use them again, good value for what it does. I use lint or shredded sticks under the tablet to get it lit.\n",
      "One is all it takes. Much lett mess than newspaper\n",
      "Comparing these to Super Cedar starters I think these are cheaper. They are definitely easier and cleaner to use (Super Cedars come wrapped in plastic, and you have to break them apart. Messy). Like these better than the Fatwood starter sticks Home Depot sells. While those start easy, they put out a lot of black, sooty, smoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "To get my nightly winter time fire going, I put 1 of these on top of a log, stack 1 more log on each side, and put some kindling (small splits, workshop scraps, etc...) above the nugget. If wood is dry the fire is raging in less then 10 minutes.\n",
      "I usually like to make these myself, but I couldn't beat the price on these.  work great to start a fire without kindling\n",
      "overall works well.  slips down with heavy items on it, but holds a fair amount of weight and with a lip to keep it from slipping, holds a lot more weight.\n",
      "I have a huge set of keys (with a self-defense keychain, pretty heavy), and I have this magnetic hook on the side of my fridge.  The magnet is very strong, and holds my keys without sliding down.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moveable hook does have a tendency to lay flat against when my keys aren't on the hook, but it doesn't bother me too much.  Definitely would recommend this product.\n",
      "The magnets are powerful. We have three on the side of our stacked laundry machines that we use to store hangers. Awesome.\n",
      "I bought this magnet to hold a dishtowel on my stainless steel refrigerator.  Granted the towel is not very heavy, but you can tell by how tightly the magnet holds to the fridge that it is quite powerful.  The swivel hook is also nice - when you brush against it while walking by, it doesn't pop the hook off the surface it's holding to.  Finally, the underside of the magnet is well covered by black plastic so it doesn't scratch the surface of expensive appliances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great buy!!  I will certainly purchase a couple more!\n",
      "They might be good for holding a pot holder or a dishtowel on a refrigerator door but not for the purpose I wanted.\n",
      "I got this magnetic hook for my mom to use as dish towel hook.  She stuck it on her refrigerator and it works perfectly.  The magnet would be strong enough to hold a bath towel.  The hook swivels from side to side, which is helpful in keeping the towel out of the way of the cupboard door next to the refrigerator.  It's the perfect solution for finding a place to hang a dish or hand towel in a small kitchen.  The plastic / rubber tip on the hook holds the towel, but allows the towel to be gabbed quickly without the towel sticking.  Great value for the price.  I looked at several stores for such a hook and couldn't find one similar.\n",
      "exactly as ordered. great product, sturdy and works well for what i needed if for (hanging purses on the back of a door). arrived on time\n",
      "The product certainly seems sturdy, but the shim, while a good idea, lacks one simple adjustment.  As it is, it can only fit on one side of the over-the-door part.  For my door, this makes the hook hit the door jam and prevents the door from closing.  If I could attach the shim to the other side of the hook, it would fit perfectly.  One little extra screw hole would have done the trick.\n",
      "Could stand them to be a little bigger but 3-4 get the job done well!\n",
      "this things are fabulous.  No more wads of paper and tons of kindling.  We have a wood fire every night.  Makes starting so simple.\n",
      "Great fire starters in my wood stove.\n",
      "Work as intended. Great help to get a fire started!\n",
      "Good price, very effective and much neater than using rolled-up newspapers.\n",
      "I usually make my own, but this work ok.  The Fatwood Fire Starter works better and burns hotter\n",
      "Works relly  great\n",
      "Not impressed at all.  They light easily enough but are so small that it takes 8-12 of them to get my fireplace going.\n",
      "Absolutely love these. They are perfect if you have a wood burning fireplace. I use 2 each time I start a new fire and they work perfectly. Truly inexpensive for what you get. I definitely recommend!!!\n",
      "Perfect for starting fire\n",
      "It is functional, but there are flaws. On the inside where it touches the door (the shorter part, on the left in the photo), there is a fastener through an extra metal piece that is very sharp and rough. It would scratch the door if used as is, so I immediately had to put some felt over it so it would not scratch. It's frustrating to have to modify a product right away to make is usable. Some of the metal is discolored. It's cheap looking and unsightly, so I won't keep it on the door when not in use. I can't close the door with the valet on it, anyway. I expected more from InterDesign and chose this more expensive product over a similar one because of the brand.\n",
      "Seems quality, no complaints, I've ordered 3 so far.\n",
      "Love these for over the door. They are very sturdy and will easily hold any winter coat or jacket you want to hang up.\n",
      "I love having this little hanger space on my door at work. I was worried that the hook would be too small to fit over the door, but I found that if I used a flathead screwdriver to remove the little piece of metal on the hook, I could fit it over the door perfectly. So it fits over my door that is 1.75\" thick. Any thicker, though, and it would not work.\n",
      "Great price for a fire starter and they work well. We use a small bit of paper to get them going but they are just what we need. We use two of them per fire (to get fire in different places) and it works great. We had been buying more expensive starters but will keep using these.\n",
      "Usually great, this box, not so great... lots of sawdust each unit seem to take to long to start, even with the blowtorch I use to start them. Go out if there isn't a great draft. Not impressed with this batch. Burn four cords a year, usually love this product, but after this batch I think fatwood will be my product of choice. Burns hotter, never goes out despite the draft. Starts wood with surface moisture, burns hot, and long to start a fire.\n",
      "Good product.\n",
      "I love saying Lightning Nuggets. Sometimes I say it when there is no need.  The country seems to be more polarized than ever, Lightning Nuggets.\n",
      "this hook is great for organizing my outfits for the next day.\n",
      "I know it seems silly to give 5 stars to a hook, but it does everything you need and it's sturdy. easily fits over the door with no problem closing.\n",
      "Pretty flimsy for a utility hook. I guess it's just for use with towels?\n",
      "Works well, and so far is holding about 60lbs with no problems. with the solid construction I don't anticipate having any issues in the future.\n",
      "This hook seems to be sturdy and it's nice that it's adjustable to various door sizes.  I've had plastic hooks break, so I'm hoping this will hold up over time.  It seems to be a thin metal, and the spot welds seen sturdy enough to hold moderate weight items.\n",
      "I love having the extra hanging space beyond the simple end-hook. Super convenient for taking clothing on hangers into the bathroom for dressing after shower. Docking a single star because valet would not work on our door with the included bumper attached, and once it was removed it doesn't fit quite snug which is causing a small amount of wear on our door. The brushed stainless steel is holding up well in our high traffic, high humidity upstairs bathroom. No signs of rust so far, will update if that changes. Overall I'd recommend this valet, and I'd purchase it again.\n",
      "It has worked as expected. The surface is not going to be pristine after first cleanup.\n",
      "Works great.  Fast shipping.\n",
      "Bought this to keep food warm in the dining room and to save space on the table during large family gatherings.  Heated quickly and evenly.  Legs provide enough height so that the cherry wood cart that it we placed it on was not harmed in any way.  Top will scratch if not careful, but not an issue for us.  Exactly what we needed; wish we had purchased this years ago.\n",
      "no temp control\n",
      "Worked well we will purchase again in future\n",
      "I've used many fire starters. Thease are the easiest and most reliable, and they are very economical, too. Make sure you use them with the flat part upthey burn better that way.\n",
      "Works okay\n",
      "Where have you been my whole life? Great product.\n",
      "Stainless steel beats a glass top any day!\n",
      "Returned it. Too big for us.\n",
      "The product can be bought on the Internet at a 31% savings.  In the past Amazon sold them directly for a great price.  I should have look around instead of just buying at a push of a key stroke.  I will look the next time.  The product is good as I have bought them for a local VFW and they love them.\n",
      "Cool hooks for the back of the door. I use this to get my suit, shirt and tie to wear the next day especially on those early mornings\n",
      "Didn't fit any of my standard doors so it's always sliding about.\n",
      "As described.  Nice quality.  Happy with purchase.\n",
      "The par around the door could use a little work on the design but other than that it works well.\n",
      "Great space saver and very sturdy. We had a plastic \"over-the-door\" hook previously... Apparently they can't hold 6 suits... This one can!\n",

      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "Highly recommended\n",
      "These are great!!!!!  I use one or two nuggets depending on how many logs I use.  The price sure beats the large expensive logs.  I have already recommended them to people.  Will continue to purchase them.\n",
      "They work great even start full size wood!\n",
      "not the best thing out there, but they work\n",
      "great for fires and lighting grills. Love'em\n",
      "These things work! Some of my fire wood was slightly damp. These nuggets kept burning long enough for the wood to catch nicely. I will purchase again as needed.\n",
      "works as expected\n",
      "little longer than I needed but works good\n",
      "I should have read the description more carefully, this is a big tray!  But just what I needed for warming plates and serving dishes for dinner parties.  I only have one oven so warming dishes was a problem.  I am buying a smaller one for daily use (just for the 2 of us) and will keep this for bigger occasions.\n",
      "Bought this one for our church when they hold socials and it's wonderful with controlled temperature and is hot and stays hot.  It's long enough to hold a lot more than the average size dishes and pans.  Made of stainless steel that wipes off nicely and always looks good.  There's also a light so you can tell it's still on.\n",
      "A great hot plate. It's big and seemed huge when first removed from box, but quickly used the surface area up with dishes and tortillas to keep. Also, was worried table underneath might get hot but stayed cool the whole time.\n",
      "Very pleased..exactly what I needed..thank you\n",
      "These are fantastic. No more fiddling with newspaper or cardboard\n",
      "It's slow to start the flame. Wasteful of the candlelighter gas!\n",
      "Works well for starting fireplace and you would need some kindling wood, too.\n",
      "It seems to be a bit deeper than standard door width so it sticks out when you close a door.  Kinda frustrating.  I used this actually to hang a wreath on a side door and it worked just fine.  However, trying to use this INDOORS did NOT work.\n",
      "I'm hooked on hanging things behind doors! This is a great solution to a lack of space in small apartments. I use this hook to hand my waterproof bike cargo bags on behind the bathroom door. It all works out great for me because when the bathroom door is open, the bags are coincidentally positioned to hover over the tub and can drip rainwater into the tub.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish the spacer was rubber rather than steel and that there was a thin layer of rubber or foam under the hook where it rests on the door because it seems like the hook could scratch paint or rub it off, but if someone is concerned they could put a strip of gaffer tape under the hook where it rests on the door.\n",
      "These are sold at 'The Container Store'. However, as always, Amazon is cheaper. Thank goodness because I found and ordered it on here before I ever saw it in store anywhere. This is stylish, functional, and simple. I am very pleased with my purchase.\n",
      "These fit over my shower stall just fine, but the overhang is twice as wide as necessary.  I thought that the back metal pad was adjustable (due to the screw head visible in the picture) but it is not.  I was able to snug the overhang with some foam insulating tape from a local hardware store.  Now the overhand is snug and the hook does not move when removing a towel.  This is a simple solution at a great price - I recommend.\n",
      "These hooks are very solid and can hold a lot of weight unlike those plastic things that break if you put a jacket on them.\n",
      "This is thin stainless steel, so it will fit on most doors.  However, the their is a thick metal pad on hte back side, so the hook can go only on the hinge side of the door.  If you have a bedroom door that swings in, you can't have the hook on the inside of the room.  Also, I felt that swinging back and forth of a heavy garment like a robe will scratch the door finish with moving metal on wood/paint. Better off mounting a permanent \"robe hook\" that you can find on this site.\n",
      "I bought this to replace a previously owned warming tray.  This one is so much better!  It seems very heavy duty, has two heating temperatures and is quite large.  I highly recommend it!\n",
      "I bought this for large family dinners.  This is large enough to keep all the dishes warm.  I'm happy I bought it.\n",
      "Selected this item as a gift and ordered two. We have used it at multiple parties and it is neat, unobtrusive and functions to all expectations.\n",
      "I don't know whats wrong with me. I just cant get a fire going, even after tutorials by professionals and an extensive YouTube education. I would surely parish in the Zombie apocalypse. However until then I will able to start fires in fireplaces, fire pits and wood stoves thanks to these. Very small, long lasting (enough for wood to catch) and 100 for a very reasonable price. Nicely done.\n",
      "Called firestarters....hmmm not quite\n",
      "Does not light easily. Luckily i had a lighter and not a match or i would have burned my fingers waiting for it to light.\n",
      "Otherwise...it works well once lit.\n",
      "Packaging a bit messy...small flakes all over box when opened.\n",
      "Overall 3 stars as its not quite as advertised \"firestarter\" yet smells nice and eventually gets my larger logs or kindling to burn.\n",
      "This product is far too wide for 1-1/4\" doors and merely droops when hung in place.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cut a thick sheet of rubberized material I had and adhered it to the inside of the hook, using high strength 3M double sided tape.\n",
      "\n",
      "It worked like a charm.\n",
      "\n",
      "The product should include self-adhesive rubber sections such that it works on variety of door widths, but either they're not thinking or the cost was deemed \"prohibitive.\"  Also, the hook should be wider.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nice hooks could be found as recently as five years ago, but not in this age of continuous cost-cutting.\n",
      "This hook is great, it's exactly what I was looking for. It'll still be going strong many years down the road, it fits my door perfectly and I'm very happy with this purchase\n",
      "Sturdy and attractive, BUT it only fits on the outside of the door. If you want the hook to to hang on the inside of the door, the padding at the top will not allow the door to close. Most of us want our bathrobe, or whatever, to hang behind the door (when it's open) and inside the room (when it's closed). A poorly thought out design.\n",
      "great product. easy to use. no fumes of smell. i just need one to start a fire in my fireplace. would recommend\n",
      "These do not work as well as we had hoped.  I purchased after reading all of the great reviews.  We had a different brand before this that we will be going back to once these are done.  They just don't seen to stay lit for us.\n",
      "Awesome little firestarters!!! Save so much time and no chemical smell!!\n",
      "We only heat with wood.  We have an outdoor stove and a fireplace.  We've tried different fire starters and this is the only one we've ordered the following year.  They just need to be lit under some kindling and they do the rest.\n",
      "They help out with getting the fire going but not as well as other fire starters\n",
      "These are THE best fire starters. They are better than the duraflames and every other brand I've tried by far. You just light one of these babies and throw it in and poof! Fire started! I bought these at Menards last year and was SUPER excited to see these on Amazon. The price is fantastic. I wouldn't buy another brand.\n",
      "These are lousy. The Duraflame Quik Starts are way better than these. Save your money and time by not buying these. These require several and even then they don't work well.\n",
      "UPDATE - I still have to use several of these but they have grown on me. I have been having better luck with them. I might purchase another box. Cant decide.\n",
      "UPDATE after my update - I ordered another box of these on Jan 26th. It is Feb. 6th right after midnight. I have been messing with these since around 9pm on Feb 5th. I am down to 19 Firestarter things. I am so aggravated with this product! Save your money and go to Sams for the Duraflame Quik Starts bricks. I have totally wasted my money this time. I hate for anyone else to do the same.\n",
      "Bought these for my husband. He's the firestarter at our house. He says they work great\n",
      "Awesome\n",
      "I received a box of sawdust!  Complete waste of money.  Out of the 100, 51 were intact.  The rest reduced to sawdust!\n",
      "Updated:  received great customerservice from Lightning Nuggets directly.  They made the problem right.  But, I had to call them directly myself.\n",
      "These work so well! Super easy to get the fire going!\n",
      "This little salvos do the trick and light the fire nicely, though it takes two of them for stubborn fires.\n",
      "used these for years great product\n",
      "Easy to light and last long enough to get the logs going.  Would buy again.\n",
      "We love these. We buy a box every year, and for our purposes, one box lasts a winter. They light as expected with only one or two duds if any. Do know that lighting with matches does take a little longer than if you used a lighter or better yet a small blow torch lighter. Just light and go. These are environmentally safe as opposed to some other fire starters. I read a while back that some people got a box that didn't work. I would suggest returning and trying again. It may have just been a bad box. So far we have purchased three boxes across three years, and haven't received a bad box yet.\n",
      "Great little fire starter.  Easy to light and just the right amount of burn to get the fire going.\n",
      "Great stuff, they take 15 seconds to light and stay burning for about 10 mins, always long enough for the wood to catch. Ill be reordering when I run out.\n",
      "Works as advertised good value for the money\n",
      "this are hype -- barely work. takes at least 2 in even a small wood burning insert.\n",
      "Did not like this purchase at all, very hard to light and they don't stay lit very long once I get it going. Easier to get the wood going then these pods.\n",
      "Wow, a whole box of these things for less than 20.00 and I can start my fireplace using 1 or 2 at a time.  Best fire starters I have used.\n",
      "Start up easy and really gets the wood buring.\n",
      "Worked will in our fire places. Start up very easily.\n",
      "Replaces paper kindling, still likely to need small wood to keep the flame expanding\n",
      "easy to use, works great\n",
      "These starters have made lighting my wood stove a breeze!  Place it first, round side down and put a split log on top, light it and close the stove door.  You're done.\n",
      "Excellent firestarters. Only takes one to light the woodburner with some newspaper and a match.\n",
      "These are the best firestarters!  We've been using them for a few years when available at a local Lowes, but lately they've been charging a lot for a small box of these 'nuggets', where Amazon was $19 per box of 100.  We burn wood in a smallish stove when it's chilly, almost every night October through spring, and one nugget starts a fire fine, two if we're in a hurry and the dogs are waiting for it to heat up.\n",
      "These are one of the better Firestarter so I've ever used and really not that bad for the price cuts down on a lot of grief trying to get my fire started\n",
      "As compared to other similar products, these are very meh. I buy fire starters in bulk for use in our wood stove, smoker and fire pit. I ordered these as a trial and I am not impressed. Again, compared to the competition (My choice is Rutland squares) these are slow to light, take up too much space, and are crumbly. Furthermore, they are a few cents each more expensive than the competition.\n",
      "Not as easy to light as other brands I have tried.  Burns ok once you finally get them going, but you need some kind of fire starter to get this fire starter started.\n",
      "Lots of mess and sawdust in the box. They do as advertised. High odor\n",
      "We love these fire starters! We used them all last winter and were starting this winter with a box of 100.\n",
      "They work GREAT just wish they lasted longer!\n",
      "I just opened a box of these firestarters. We stockpile them because we use so many of them....there was supposed to be 100 of these in the box & there were just over 50. I'd call this a total rip off. I guess I'll have to wait til I open another box to see if I'd order these again. Very disappointing. Obviously we loike the product as we purchased boxes of them.....\n",
      "Works really well! Can even be used by those that have a hard time keeping a fire going!\n",
      "These firestarters are exactly what I was looking for. They light easily and burn plenty long enough to ignite firewood that may not be super dry. This box will last me quite a while and is saving me a lot of time vs trying to start fires with crumpled up newspaper.\n",
      "Bad product. Difficult to light. Does not generate enough heat or flame to ignite lump charcoal in my Big Green Egg. I have used almost an entire box. Not happy with performance at all. It has proven to yield poor results especially in trying to get HOT fires going for steaks and pizza. Used other fire starter products and this is by far the worst.\n",
      "My hubby loves these!\n",
      "Once they're lit, the do a good job of starting a fire, but I have to sit there with a blowtorch for several minutes to get them going.  It literally takes me less time to gather kindling, and light it - than to get these things going.  I would not buy them again as they do not save me any time or effort in getting a fire going.\n",
      "great price!\n",
      "These work great! We camp a lot and I have never used a better product for starting fires.\n",
      "I bought some Irish Peat logs and had a heck of a time getting them to burn so i purchased these and they burn very hot giving my peat logs enough heat and fire to burn on their own. I am very happy with these!! No need for kindling, or any liquid to start up a nice bonfire or a fire in your fireplace. These are all you need. I use 2 for every bonfire to get a great fire going.\n",
      "Product is difficult to light and does not stay lit in windy conditions\n",
      "One of these get the fire up in 15-20 minutes. Two of these get it roaring in 10! They are easy to travel with and keep in a dry zip lock. Get them, you won't regret it.\n",
      "I have used many different types of starters. These are really no brainers which is what ya want on a cold morning. I have used the Fat Sticks which work great as well, but those take longer to start and may need to use multiple to get the fire going. One of these and I stop back ten minutes later and close the door. Fat sticks are cool but for straight utility these are the way to go.\n",
      "These work well and burn longer than most, but they are definitely harder to light.\n",
      "First of all, the box leaks sawdust everywhere (including onto the other items in this Amazon order). Also bits of sawdust fall off when you handle them. Next, they do not light that easily. Finally, one will not start a fire without use of kindling. I tried to light dry hardwood, and it took about five of these things to get it going. Too small to use on a fireplace grate.\n",
      "Well, what could be simpler? Put one of these starters at the bottom of the fire, dome side down. Build a pyramid over it. Light up. Inexpensive and it just works. The photo is of the fire from the first starter out of the box, less than 5 minutes after lighting.\n",
      "BIG PILE OF DUST!\n",
      "We've bought these a couple times now as they seem to work the best at starting fires. We've found them to work equally well both indoors and outdoors. We sometimes use 2 to get a big fire going faster in the winter, but one always gets the job done.\n",
      "Exactly as advertised.\n",
      "They take about 5-7 seconds to actually light, but these work great for lighting charcoal in a chimney for a charcoal grill.  Much easier and more reliable than using wadded up newspapers.\n",
      "Work great\n",
      "Probably misunderstood product information. These are nuggets and do not work as well as the sheets. I would not buy these as we use for camping'\n",
      "Excellent fire starters.  I use them in my Big Green Egg.\n",
      "This stuff fires really quick, i love it !\n",
      "We built a fire pit and bought some logs and couldn't get them started, so I bought these to help out. They do take a minute to actually catch, but once they do, they will get the job done. I have found the best way to do this is to put them upside down in my fire pit and light the bottom .once it's on fire, i use my fire starter to flip it over then put my logs on top. I will definitely buy these again when I run out\n",
      "These are great. Easily gets a campfire going without a lot of fuss. Also like it because you can use it to start charcoal for cooking without the fear of toxic chemicals.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Lightning-Nuggets-N100SEB-Firestarters-Super-Economy-Box-of-Fire-Starting-Nuggets-100-Count/dp/B000KC009Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Lightning Nuggets N100SEB Firestarters Super Economy Box of Fire-Starting Nuggets, 100 Count</a>\n",

      "Better then cotton ball and Vaseline. So far this product has not let me down in starting a fire under some not so good conditions.\n",
      "Absolutely love these! So easy to use and I only need one to start my woodstove as long as I have 5-6 kindling sticks. They take a few seconds to light but they stay lit about 15 minutes.\n",
      "These work well but they don't stay lit as easily as some of the other squares so in high winds or in a smoker you might have trouble getting them lit.  Even once they are going they may flame out with a small gust or something covering.  I buy them because you get a huge box at a good price and they are environmentally friendly.\n",
      "perfect\n",
      "We have tried so many fire starters I lost count.  These are by FAR the BEST!!!!! Easy to light and create a nice glow.  We don't need much, if any,  kindling, paper or cardboard with it to start the fire. Yay!  Thank you!\n",
      "Clean - these work great ----- only need one to get a nice fire in my wood stove.\n",
      "much cleaner than fatwood that smokes and leaves a stain under the ashes.\n",
      "Not the best.\n",
      "products like this are why i love amazon... great price, product and delivery  -- Terry Hunefeld, Borrego Springs, CA\n",
      "....LIGHT MY FIRE! THESE BABIES ARE HOT...THE BEST I'VE EVER USED.\n",
      "This Broil King warmer just blew me away. It was PERFECT for Thanksgiving! Free shipping too! At first I thought it was too large, but it was just right. Major kudos to the seller & Amazon. Even my husband agreed & that just plain doesn't happen in this house. He did, however, remind me that we had 4 Cuisinart trays that I bought last year in storage in the garage (also good products). I won't buy any more warming trays for a loooong time!\n",
      "Work pretty good.  I prefer the Fat Wood after trying both.\n",
      "works well.\n",
      "Good fire starters at a fair price.  Take a bit longer than expected to light, but do the job.\n",
      "One nugget starts a fire and burns well until the other wood, if dry, catches and burns.  Would have liked them to be in smaller bags instead of loose in the box but that's a small issue.\n",
      "Reviews I read about this being a good product were right.  All it takes is one to start a fire (with small amount of kindling).\n",
      "You cannot fail to make a fire if you use these little nuggets.  I've used them in the hearth and in a fire pit, and whoosh!  If you are looking for an easy firestarter, I can highly recommend this one.\n",
      "These work pretty well once you get them going, but you have to hold the match against them for quite a while in order to make them ignite.\n",
      "LOVE THESE!!\n",
      "Best fire starters\n",
      "I have other warming trays that do not keep food warm.  This once actually gets hot enough to keep things warm and will burn them if you leave it on high.  It is a nice size that you have have several items on it with two different temps.\n",
      "This came to me as a slightly used item.  It has some damage to it but nothing that would keep me from using it.  I ordered it knowing this so was not surprised when I saw the reason for same.  Sometimes one can profit from accepting a used thing.  This warmer is huge.  I have it in place right now, plugged in and ready for all the dishes I need to keep my Thanksgiving feast warm for my family and guests.  I have always wanted one of these warmers and am thrilled to have this one, slightly bent in one area or not.  I have sent for instructions as nothing came with it.  It has setting from 1-4 if I remember correctly  and it does turn off when plugged in.  Has a red ON light when on.  Love it.  Broil King, I think I love you too for solving the problem of keeping food warm when I need to.  PS  I needed this in a hurry so I requested 2 day delivery.  Ordered on Friday, arrived on Monday.  You rock Amazon. PS 2......it does have dual control so guess you can only fire up one side or both.  Wow......great feature.\n",
      "I was worried from reviews that this thing would blow circuits in my old house, but it didn't.  It does get hot enough to cook on, though.  I just set it up on a serving table and put the hot stuff on it, and it did a good job.  Not hard to clean up either.\n",
      "I LOVE my Broil King jumbo warming tray!  It fits quite a few dishes and is perfect for buffet dinners, large parties, SuperBowl parties, etc.  Great purchase!\n",
      "This heating tray was plugged into an GFI outlet in my kitchen to test it and the outlet needed to be reset.  We plugged it into a regular outlet and one of the control knobs did not work.  I returned it immediately.\n",
      "Work Really Great!!\n",
      "works great\n",
      "these are amazing and cost effective.  use only one per each roaring fire in the fireplace\n",
      "I really have liked these, never use more than 1 to start the fire. We have been using the shavings fire starter for years and think I will continue to get this kind in the future, way less mess. I keep them i a plastic ice cream bucket tucked next to the chair by the fireplace and they are super easy to grab one out without the mess!\n",
      "Work well and great price.\n",
      "Makes it so much easier to light the fire in the wood stove.\n",
      "Very nice when we aren't getting newspapers any longer.  Much hotter and longer lasting for getting the fire going!\n",
      "Easy to use, in the beginning you may need 2 to get your fire going...\n",
      "Easy fire starters in our wood stove.  Quick lighting, and no chemicals other than the natural oils in the wood itself; environmentally very safe product with no potentially toxic fumes for those who are sensitive to be worried about.\n",
      "We have been using these for years and won't use anything else.  This size package and price is very economical. At 2 fires a day (morning & evening), this is a 7 week supply; just over $3 a week.  Glad to have found this thru Amazon.\n",
      "these are without a doubt the best fire starters I have used.  I looked at a lot,,,,have used a lot,,,,,but these give more fire, bigger flames and last longer than any I've used.  Two is all I've ever used and it starts a nice fire EVERY TIME !!!!!\n",
      "Affordable and effective.  Rarely, i'll need to use a second one to get a fire going.  I'll be getting more.\n",
      "Best thing about these is the smell. Smells like saw dust. Works very well\n",
      "Easy to use and effective\n",
      "work very well.\n",
      "I've been using these firestarters since 2000 for, first, a woodstove and now, a fireplace insert.  They are so much cheaper and more efficient than fatwood.  Moreover, my chimney sweeper told me that their use will result in less creosote buildup than newspaper.  As one reviewer correctly noted, they won't light with one small match:  however, put a small piece of newspaper down, put the nugget atop the paper, and light the paper.  The burning paper will ignite the nugget.  I also use a handheld butane lighter.  Nuggets light best when the round side is down.  Also, take your time and wait 20 seconds for the nugget's fire to become established, and then put down your first small piece of kindling on top: if you just pile it on, you may extinguish the fire.  Then add the next small piece of kindling.  When, after a minute or so, they are happily getting started, put a small starter log on top.  And so on.  The nuggets actually burb for at least 10 minutes as long as the kindling is added slowly and carefully.  If, after burning for a long time without tending, you need to re-start your fire, doing so with another nugget is so much easier than rolling up and enticing a ton of newspaper to get the fire going!  I've always ordered the 50-count before but I'm about to switch to the 100-count.\n",
      "Tons of firestarters for much cheaper than some of the other brands.  They always work great for me.  I flip them upside down and they are easier to light.\n",
      "great items, really work well, definitely recommend to everyone, campers, people that have fireplaces, etc\n",
      "Easy light\n",
      "Did not work for me- used multiple starters per fire with kindling and logs would not light.\n",
      "Wow, its alot of nuggets and will last the whole winter for us. Arrived on time. Packaging very minimal. A little pricey so will not buy again.\n",
      "I've been buying this for a couple years now & never disappointed.\n",
      "Okay, but don't burn long and hard to position to get good results.\n",
      "Starts fires with both dry and wet wood\n",
      "works great; lights up with just one every  time\n",

      "The reviewers are spot on with these!  My fires suck without using these and man do they work well, even in windy weather.\n",
      "These things are great!  They light pretty easy, but burn a decent time.  I welded little mesh baskets on my fire place grate to hold these.  No more newspaper needed for me!  First used these in New Mexico at a fancy spa/resort.  Now we use them at home.\n",
      "Perfect product..i have a brick oven in my backyard and this is my go to fire starter\n",
      "Work well but lighting them initially takes a moment, you probably want a lighter as matches don't seem to do it without using a few of them\n",

      "This is a great buy. I use them in the fireplace and for starting my grill.\n",

      "Good product.  Love that they are non toxic too.\n",
      "takes a little to get the nugget started but it burns well and only takes one to start a load of charcoal in a weber chimney.\n",
      "Love these, great starters.\n",
      "I do not recommend using these to start your charcoal in a Kamado (Big Green Egg, etc.) style smoker/grill.  I used them in my Primo Kamado and even after burning the coal for a while you could detect a chemical smell.  I tried them a few time and always noticed a slight petroleum-like taste to the food.  Only after burning the coal very long and very hot did the smell go away, and by then most of the charcoal was turning to ash.\n",
      "\n",
      "These seem to work fine for starting normal fires, and you probably wouldn't notice the smell in a fireplace or firepit.  But in a concentrated cooking area like a Kamado I definitely do not recommend using these.\n",
      "I was surprised at how small they were.  It had me concerned one wouldn't be enough to get afire going.  Boy was I wrong.  They light easily and quickly.  They also burn hot with a nice size flame and last for like 10 minutes, more than enough to get a fire going.\n",
      "these work really well.\n",
      "Great, starts the kindling right up.\n",
      "These are great.\n",
      "thought they would be just the thing but they were hard to light and went out a lot.  I went back to my old fire starters.\n",
      "Nice & Easy\n",
      "These things are fabulous.  They light easily (even easier if you use a plumbing torch, and ya' get style points, too, but matches work, if ya' must), and they burn long enough to get properly dried splits of firewood burning nicely.  Sure, you could roll up newspaper, or make, collect, gather, and precariously nest tinder, or go through any other tedious, old fashioned way of starting a fire.  But life is too short.  These things just work.  Treat yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, they do seem to lose a bit of their easy-to-light-ness if they sit open all summer -- if you're not expecting to light 100+ fires every winter (that is, if you don't heat your home with wood fires, as I do), maybe buy a smaller box.  But if you need this many, they're a great product, and worth every penny.\n",
      "After using these to start our wood burning stove I feel like a Neanderthal for ever using anything else!  Can't wait to try them out when we go camping!\n",

      "I would definitely recommend these to anyone who regularly builds fires.\n",

      "These are a winter standby.\n",
      "Thank you!\n",
      "Awesome fire starters! We burn wood in 2 wood burners all winter long (inside of house) and these are the best fire starters we have found. No issues getting them to light initially, they burn long enough to get the fire going good (even on some greener wood) and only 1 needed at a time. Highly recommend!\n",
      "I do a lot of fires thru the winter. Would use the fire blocks and cut them up. This product is ready to light your stove or fireplace with one piece. My new fire starters. Highly recommend\n",
      "Work great.  Won't use anything else.\n",
      "I wish we knew about these earlier - perfect fire starter for our wood burner\n",
      "Great for older wood stoves. My son uses these daily and reorders when needed. Great item, great price and delivered to his door. When you have an older stove like he has you need a little extra to get the fire going fast and these do the trick every time.\n",
      "I have been using this product for about 2-3 years now in our wood stove.  I live in upstate New York and use my stove daily during our cold winters.  Have to say, this product works great, every single time.  Easy to store in its box near the stove, easy to light, and each \"nugget\" lasts at least 5 minutes or more.  The \"nuggets\" are easy to light and, it has never failed to start a fire for me.  Sure beats newspaper and anything else I have tried.  What a convenient product. Highly recommended.\n",
      "work perfectly! one gets even slightly wet food fired up!\n",
      "We have a wood stove and have used all kinds of starters, and these were our least favorite. They are hard to light, and burn out quickly. Fatwood and newspaper were still necessary to make these work at all, and we can manage fine without the starter that way. There are other starters that come in flat squares that work much better.\n",
      "Love them. Work great try them!\n",
      "Exactly as inticipated - a wonderful addition to my CD collection. I would highly recommend this recording.\n",
      "love these.  It just takes one to start a wonderful fire!  very easy to light.  just hold a candle lighter on the bottom of it  (flat side) and it lights right up.  the rounded part takes a bit longer to catch fire but it works as well.  It will burn for about 10 minutes with a very strong flame and catch your wood so you have a really nice fire very fast.\n",
      "We use these all winter to start a fire in our wood stove, we like them because there is no heavy paraffin burning!\n",
      "Worked great\n",
      "These work great and buying bulk are not expensive.\n",
      "These work great!  I highly recommend them.\n",
      "These are great to using any time and particularly during the winter months if you discover some of your \"seasoned\" wood is not so seasoned!\n",
      "Simple to use and gets your wood stove or fireplace going quickly.\n",
      "I know there are people who can start a fire with a single match and a wood chip. There are plenty of techniques to keep a fire going overnight. But not me. No. I struggle almost every time. And every morning I start a new fire in a cold stove. Part of this is choice. Most of it isn't. I'm fond of firestarters. I used to like those duraflame starters but haven't been able to find them cheaply anymore so I bought these and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Wood-Products-9910-Fatwood-Box-10-Pounds/dp/B000HHO4W6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wood Products 9910 Fatwood Box, 10 Pounds</a>&nbsp;to compare.\n",
      "My fires are all with seasoned hardwood, kindling, and newspaper. Using the one of the nuggets I had a modest fire going in about 20 minutes. Using two of the fatwood sticks the fire was roaring along in about 10 minutes.\n",
      "Here's the thing. In 30 minutes, the fires were both the same. In fact, it seemed to me that the nugget fire had burned more slowly through the kindling and caught more of the larger logs on fire, while the fatwood had devoured the kindling too quickly to get a good start on the logs. But it didn't really make a difference. Both fires burned.\n",
      "The difference comes at the price point, both are around $23. There are a hundred nuggets per box and around a hundred fatwood sticks. But if you use two fatwood sticks per fire (as suggested) that's only 50 fires compared to a hundred nugget fires.\n",
      "They were not in a plastic bag so they were dried out already, pretty disappointed. I won't buy them again like this.\n",
      "Makes starting the fire SO easy. So instead of sitting there for up to 10 minutes sometimes rearranging wood, sticking various cardboard and sticks in (or going outside in the cold to try to find dry kindling), I just pop this in, light and minutes later I have a roaring fire. Can't live without these.\n",
      "I have mixed feelings about this product.  I usually start my wood stove using lots of old paper and cardboard and a little kindling. I use a lighter fluid starter. I don't have a lot of kindling this year though. So I was hoping I could throw one or two of these in there, light them up and be done with it.  So first the good news - once these are lit, they burn for a good long while (several minutes), and my fire is usually nicely going by the time they are worn out. Now the bad news - they are really hard to light. I sat there with the lighter directly on the nugget, for a good 20 seconds, and it still wasn't lit. I purchased these in order to start my fire, but now I need something to start the fire for my firestarter nuggets. That doesn't seem quite right.  If you can actually get them lit, they work great, I guess.  I only use very dry, seasoned wood, so if you have green wood, I don't think they would work very well.\n",
      "These things are the best.  I've tried so many different fire starters to use in my wood-burning stove and these light the fastest and stay lit the longest to help the wood catch.  Great product.\n",
      "Work great.\n",
      "Work great.\n",
      "The best starters I;ve tried yet.\n",
      "not so hot!\n",
      "These work great, especially if you use 5 or 6 at a time.\n",
      "I can start a large wood stove fire with just one of these and spare kindling. 100 will get me through the winter (especially as I often have sufficient coals to not need one every day). They do need to be intuitively \"upside down\"/round side down - I hadn't read the instructions with my initial attempts.\n",
      "Can't say enough good about these. Does exactly what it should, and is affordable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tip: One biscuit will do the trick. But when you have company, use 2 biscuits. Makes the fire more spread out and impressive looking. :)\n",
      "These work really well.\n",
      "I buy a box of these every year for the wood stove fire starting process; they work great.\n",
      "I buy a box every year.  Wonderful starter to use to start normal size logs in my wood stove. Easy to use, economical.\n",
      "A sample came with my new wood stove insert & I was sold on their ease of starting a fire. Great product.\n",
      "I'm probably on my 4th or 5th case of these, I love them and will keep buying. I knock them down one star because they seem a little expensive. they're just not a 'blow my mind\" 5 star deal.\n",
      "Light the nugget(s);  let it/them warm the flu to get the draft started; and, then gently place wood criss-crossed over top. Works great!\n",
      "One of the best fire starters that I've tried. With some of the other products, it takes several of the starters to ignite, but with this product I found that it only took one. Hopefully, the box of 100 will last through the season.\n",
      "Worked great so far\n",
      "They work great.  One or two, and you're in business!\n",
      "Boy, these really work great!  I am really bad at starting fires and getting them to go on the first try, and since getting these have not failed to successfully light either a campfire or a fire in my cabin fireplace since getting them.  They work awesome and flawlessly.  I can't recommend them enough.\n",
      "Small and convenient. Burns a long time so gets the fire started.\n",
      "These are great.\n",
      "These rock. We heat with a wood stove and frequently light slash piles outside where I am the designated firestarter. I prefer these over a drip torch. Those complaining they take too long to light try this. Hold one in your hand and light the edge. THEN set it down and place the wood around it while it burns. I agree they are hard to light unless the match is right under them; that is, it's hard to light one by holding the flame next to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have tried them all and these work the best. I would be glad to buy them at a local store but everybody stopped carrying them.\n",
      "I'm surprised at all the 5 star reviews for these.  I find them to be much more slow to light, and significantly less reliable than a single Fatstick (which I've ordered because these aren't cutting it). I'll use or give away the rest of my Super Economy Box.  I'm not sure if the ones I've gotten are old or stale, but it takes much longer to get them to burn, and they do a poor job of starting adjacent wood.  With a single Fatstick on a stack of 8 logs, I can get a fire going with a single lighter flick.  Not so with these.  In fact, I have not yet had a successful fire light with these alone - each time I have had to add a Fatstick.\n",
      "look these wood\n",
      "These are great little fire starters. It takes a moment for them to get going, but once they do you can load your wood on top of them and get your fire started. I received one as a promotional item when I bought my wood burning stove and quickly ran out to buy some more. They're not expensive and not having to fuss with newspaper / lots of kindling / etc. is well worth the price.\n",
      "These were ok. We wanted them to help start a fire in our chiminea outside.  They didn't last very long and we still needed some help in getting the fire lit.\n",
      "Pretty sure I have forgotten how to start a fire with anything but these nuggets...we order in bulk and they last all season long. Great product.\n",
      "Ok they work, but my wood was only seasoned a year and it took too many.\n",
      "These work really well for starting camp fires, they burn a long time. I usually use two per fire.\n",
      "Great item here, I am a repeat customer. I get the big economy box and I can get my wood stove going with just one of these little gems. I don't know why the manufacturer has to charge double on their own website. Must have slept through the marketing part of business school.\n",
      "My husband LOVES these fire starters! We received a sample when we purchased a wood stove but the shop owner did not carry them. We searched on Amazon and this appeared to be the same product for a good price. It is more cost effective to buy in bulk than just a few at a time. They do not go bad so will store nicely from year to year if you have leftovers after the winter. It really does help in starting a fire quicker and easier. You will not regret trying this product!\n",
      "These firestarters will light with flame held at the edge for about 10 seconds.  They burn long enough to get dry wood burning in your fireplace.  They are compact and are not inividually wrapped, so there is no time spent unwrapping.  These work great and I will continue to use them.  Simple, and, effective.\n",
      "ok I get it there like organic firestarters. First of all they don't immediately catch on fire it takes a couple times with it lighter. Kind of annoying for a firestarter. But yeah other than that they work\n",
      "These starters work great and burn well long enough to get the fire going with little amount of kindling.  The main thing is to put them in the fire as instructed - (looks like upside down) - otherwise they are hard to light.\n",
      "They work, fires start with ease.  Just bought another box... I can't live without these!\n",
      "These things are AMAZING! I live in a small mountain town in Colorado where winters are intense, cold and long. I'm on my third box of these lightning nuggets and have been recommending them to everyone I know. I've even given out some to try and everyone ends up buying their own.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nugget is easy to light and stays well lit for 20-30 minutes, ensuring your logs catch fire.\n",

      "As a kid we made these same type of things but pricing out ingredients I discovered these were cheaper even before factoring in my time to make them!  Great lighters, highly recommended.\n",
      "AWFUL.  WORST FIRESTARTER EVER.  DON'T BUY THESE.\n",
      "Pretty good but they take about 30 seconds to catch fire. They burn for about 10 minutes as advertised.\n",
      "These work great and were a life saver for when my wife and kids needed help getting the wood stove going!\n",
      "Use these for almost every fire, and they're great.\n",
      "These are highly recommended. They work great for camping (carry in a zip-lock baggie), RV'ing for starting a campfire, AND burning brush piles, even if it is raining. I would and likely will. and I hope this helps.\n",
      "these may be good for indoor fireplace, they don't do well starting an outdoor campfire.\n",
      "When we need it quickly, these never fail to start our fire.  Not a lot of tinder or fatwood needed with well seasoned wood and the nuggets.\n",
      "my favorite fire starter\n",
      "Took out of shipping box and there was crumbs all in the outside box from the fire starters. Haven't opened the original box of fire starters yet but it sounds like there's a lot of broken ones.\n",
      "Great stuff\n",
      "These make home fires much easier\n",
      "Poor product that is very difficult to light, once lit doesn't burn very long - maybe 10 minutes.\n",
      "We are very spoiled with the first free ones we received when we purchased our wood stove.\n",
      "I have to use several of them to get a fire going.  They often burn out before the wood catches good enough to burn completely on its own.\n",
      "I was a little skeptical initially,  but after using these the first time. I am a very satisfied. However it takes me 2 at a time to start and maintain the fire. So I'm good for the next 50 fires....woo hoo :)\n",
      "Won't ignite oak. Will ignite Doug Fir 2x4 squares.\n",
      "worked good\n",
      "These were not great... just okay.  Had to use more than recommended and even then had a hard time keeping my fire going.  They just weren't right for me.  Watch out... they look delicious.  Well, they do remind me of some coconut covered snowball or something.\n",
      "No more rolled up newspaper for me.  These start every time, no residue, no loose bits of burning paper floating around anymore. I use them at home and keep some in the vehicles and my backpack for ready use when needed.\n",
      "These work GREAT!!!!  Will be buying these again. So convenient to have with our woodstove. Light easily and last until wood catches fire.\n",
      "I will never struggle with kindling again!  No unpleasant smell.  Long burning.  In my woodstove I use two at a time with a couple pinecones wrapped loosely in paper.  Magic!\n",
      "I needed to get another cord of wood this year. Since it was in the middle of this unbelievable winter, all the wood was ice covered and wet. A few times I had to use two pellets but the wood burned.  I'll never be without these little beauties\n",
      "Awesome. Nice dome shape. Fire lights anyway you turn it.\n",
      "Makes lighting a fire so easy!\n",
      "Good value.\n",
      "these are the best fire starters I have ever used. one does the trick.\n",
      "Product works perfectly. Starts my fireplace easily every time.\n",
      "Help get pellet stove up to temp quicker.\n",
      "We have a woodstove in the house and barbecue with charcoal year round. These nuggets work great for both applications. No paper needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "No need to use kindling to get the woodstove fired up.  No need for lighter fluid and the off flavors that can cause. These nuggets leave no scent on the charcoal or food.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've tried other types including the fatwood types. These are superior and more economical. My husband has used them for more than two years with consistent results.\n",
      "These Nuggets is the right size to start a fire in my fireplace. One nugget is enough. I put a lighted match on the top to start the burning. I put the wood on when the top is burning and did not wait for the whole thing engulf in fire.  I do not have to break up the other fire starter into the nugget size anymore. I found the full brick of fire starter is over kill. This is nice, simple, price is right  and does the job. Right shape to get a broad flame on the top. It is pretty clever product overall.\n",
      "Probably one of the best cost/use fire starting products on the market.\n",
      "Worst product I have ever bought to start a fire. I have a very good Napoleon wood insert with a six inch insulated liner and it takes a minimum of five nuggets to even start a fire and I had to keep feeding the nuggets in so I probably used 8 to 10. The nuggets are almost impossible to start with a lighter and matches- forget it!  I am using three year old seasoned wood with a moisture reading of 16% so I know its not the wood. Also when opening the package the box was filled with fine granular sawdust that spilled everywhere. Wish I could rate this product a negative star instead of a one star.\n",
      "These basically don't work. I wanted an alternative to kindling for quick wood fires at home. Although more expensive, the Duraflame fire starters work great.\n",
      "Stick with the fire starter bricks\n",
      "The reason why I bought this item was because I'm a newbie at starting the woodstove and have been experiencing problems keeping it going in the beginning.\n",
      "After a few weeks, instead of using 1 Nugget, I decided to use 2 Nuggets , lighting both with a igniter (wind resistant) with small to medium size twigs on top of the nuggets.\n",
      "Now that I have figured this out, I'm pretty happy. You still need newspaper or cardboard (which someone suggested) to keep the fire going in case it goes out.\n",
      "The great idea behind these Nuggets is that they are held together with wax and they will burn for at least the first 10 minutes, so you have a much higher chance of keeping your fire building, and not getting frustrated anymore by learning your fire went out 15 minutes later without using these nuggets!\n",
      "Starts fire in no time. Small size - about the size of an egg. Well made.\n",
      "These were a life saver. No more need to light up a bunch of newspapers to get the fire going.\n",
      "These are fairly small are shaped like half of a sphere.  They are made up of wood chips encased in some kind of waxed.  I was worried that they would be too small and not provide enough heat, but they seem to burn for length periods of time and do a great job starting the fire.  Overall, I am happy with them and would likely order again.\n",
      "makes starting a fire easy.  I use northern idaho co. energy logs, wouldn't want to do it any other way ...\n",
      "Cutting up Duraflame logs into small pieces is MUCH better than this.  It took 3 of the nuggets to get a fire burning with dry wood.  I thought these would work better from online reviews.\n",
      "These are really fantastic. I like the idea of them being non-toxic.  They light quickly and provide a great alternative to chemical-based gel blocks. Also, for a box of 100, they price is a great value.\n",
      "used these nuggets for 3 years now. only takes 1 to start your fire every time..\n",
      "Excellent product. Fantastic price a lot cheaper and better then the traditional fire sticks.\n",
      "Great!\n",
      "great product\n",
      "These really work.. Lots of fire starter in a small package. They are easy to light. I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 because sometimes it takes 2 to light my fireplace.\n",
      "These are clean and clean-burning, but they are not easy to get lit. I have to hold my stick lighter (or long match) to the nugget for a solid 30 seconds for it to get lit. Once it lights, it burns long enough to get the wood going - so technically yes it does work.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if I have to go through half a stick lighter or box of matches to get this thing lit, how much effort am I really saving? I've tried other firestarters and had better success on getting them actually lit. When I run through this box I will likely not buy another and search elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "As some other reviewers have said, it would be wise to have a backup plan or another option in addition to these if you do get them.\n",

      "Been using these for years, have tried many others before I discovered Lightning Nuggets, just tuck one in with your firewood and light the edge of the nugget, or light a bit of paper under the grate to catch the nugget on fire and you will have a fire going in no time.\n",
      "You won't be sorry you bought them, They Work!\n",

      "Good product ... will get that fire started and going for sure!\n",
      "I'm not impressed. It takes allot of lighter fuel to get these started and when you are lighting 3 or 4 nuggets, you better have a backup. I will go back to the Duraflame Firestarters.\n",
      "These work great!  No problems. No complaints.\n",
      "Love these\n",
      "These are the best for starting fires in our wood stove.  This is the 2nd box I have ordered.\n",
      "they work\n",
      "Our favorite way to light our wood burning stove.\n",
      "These nuggets are very hard to light and be kept lit... won't buy them again. At nearly 3/$1, someone's getting rich quick and it's not me.\n",
      "Very Good Fire starters.\n",
      "these fire starters work well to light my wood furnace. easy to light. would be great to start a outside fireplace/ pit. use these all the time\n",
      "These are great\n",
      "These are fabulous and work almost immediately as starters!\n",
      "good deal\n",
      "Very good as described\n",
      "We rely on two wood stoves for our heat and have tried many different kinds of starters. This one works the best.\n",
      "We use these all winter. They work so much better than newspaper. They start a whole fire with just one nugget. Just light and stack the wood around it and you soon have a super fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Con\n",
      "\n",
      "Only thing is the box is messy when you open it and transfer the nuggets to another container.\n",
      "This item worked great just as the title states, for starting fires! It made the winters much easier to bear!\n",
      "We use our wood stove all the time and have to use two of these to get it started. Guess we are more used to the longer starters.  Not bad for the proce but they take a little longer to light since they are not wrapped in paper.\n",
      "They are ok.  Hard to light sometimes.  Difficult to have the fire catch sometimes as well.  Most likely would not purchase again.\n",
      "Their delivery to my residence was almost very good.  They work wonderfully and I'm sure they'll be a boon to starting the charcoal for the up-coming bar-b-ques in May and all summer and warm Fall months this year.\n",
      "This makes lighting the fire a so easy!  I only wish I had known about this earlier. I would recommoned this product.  It makes lighting a fire easy/breezy!\n",
      "Love this product. They are fantastic! When my husband showed me how to use them it was so easy for me. They start the fire really quick. We have order this product several times already. Seller and product recommended 100%\n",
      "I originally bought these on the clearance rack at a large discount store in the late spring once fireplace seasons was coming to a close.  I was fearful I'd never find them again but am so happy that amazon carries them regularly now.  We use 2 nuggets to start a fire in the indoor fireplace and they work great everytime (assuming our wood is relatively dry and seasoned).  We also use them to start wood fires in our outdoor pit.  One box of 100 gets us through a year, as I've found that I reorder about every February year after year.  Great deal, great product.\n",
      "No one should ever be buying and using that toxic, nasty liquid charcoal starter in cans. These nuggets work beautifully for campfires and charcoal. Probably would also be great for fireplace starters, but I can't attest to that. I take these on every camping trip. I just wish that stores would put these on their shelves instead of the toxic liquid starters.\n",
      "I have used one case to Lightning Nuggets per winter season for the last three years.  Only one is require if the firewood is reasonably seasoned if the wood is too wet, it takes two Nuggets plus kindling. Moral - do not use wet wood!!\n",
      "Environmentally friendly or not...these aren't the same as the starter logs which really get a wet bunch of logs going.  These are probably fine for a camp fire or playing camp fire (but then use small branches which work better).  Next time, I will buy a box of lighter logs and just cut them in pieces for better results.\n",
      "i had to use 5 to get some sort of fire going and stil needed tons of paper to get any real flame\n",
      "what did i do all those years. well i guess paper is the answer. those guys work extremely well and lit up the fire in no time.\n",
      "For years I have been using another brand of fire starter found in a local store.  It doesn't take an entire block to start a fire, so the blocks were cut into pieces, which is time consuming and messy.  That fire starter wasn't the easiest to get burning.  Part way into this winter, I ran out of my normal fire starters and my local store had none in stock, so I turned to Amazon.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the Lightning Nuggets.  They are amazing!  I put one in the bottom of the wood stove and it catches on fire quickly.  I don't have to hold a match or lighter to it like I did with the other.  This product will now be my permanent fire starter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ONLY minor complaint I have is that little pieces of the starters chip off inside the box during shipping and since the box isn't completely sealed, some of the little pieces got on some of the other products that I had also ordered.  If the starters were inside a bag, in the box, this would prevent the pieces from getting on other things.  Then again, if it is going to raise the price, let it the way it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "I highly recommend this starter.\n",
      "These take a good bit to get them light, but then they stay lit for a while. I was torn because the other ones I had lit up much faster and weren't such a pain to get lit, but I guess these are better because they don't burn down so quickly. I'll probably be back to buy more.\n",
      "These lil' firestarters are just as described and work just great in my wood stove. I'll definitely reorder next fall.\n",
      "I had to get a new wood stove do to a chimney fire and was encouraged to use fire starters instead of paper.  The guy who installed my new chimney and stove gave me some square fire starters that he got from Fleet Farm for the same price as these except he got 144.  He gave me 10 of those and they never failed.  I have used about 10 of these so far with mixed results.  Overall they work fine.  They don't start really easily.  I find myself wasting two or three matches in an attempt to get them started.  Once they are started they work fine.  I do not always need small logs but when I use larger logs they have to be very dry for these fire starters to work.  I will finish up this box but may try a different brand next winter.\n",
      "I was using these, but prefer the fatwood for fire starting. These can be messy and flake easily, requiring a clean up of the area.\n",
      "We have tried three different kinds and these seem to work the best at getting the fire burning good the first time yu light it..These get hotter nd stay burning longer  then the other. The other work but some take more than one or two to get it going.\n",
      "These are an economical way to start your fireplace fire.  Also these work great to start briquettes in a charcoal briquette chimney.\n",
      "These babies work fast. I used to use fatwood but they were hard to light and keep lit. These light easily and burn well resulting in my firewood catching fire quickly.\n",
      "I am really enjoying starting a fire for about 25 cents with just a lighter and no kindling.  This is so easy I have let my 5 year old start his own fire a couple times.  I will be suing this item more.\n",
      "Love them!  Starting a fire is so much easier now. No more trying to use charcoal lighter to start a wood fire from scratch. These are very economical, and best of all, they do what they say they will do.\n",
      "Starts with first light. No fumes, and stays burning longer than those smelly bricks other companies offer. 100 starters pack into a small box for easy storage.\n",
      "This is a less expensive way to start fires than Duraflame.\n",
      "\n",
      "Husband says these work very well. A great investment for hours of fireside bliss.\n",
      "Really like these and keep buying them.  I put a piece of newspaper or two over top to light them, but you can just have a lighter point a flame at these for ~30s and they'll catch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Typically just need one of these and 4-5 pieces of newspaper and my stove does the rest to get the fire going.\n",
      "We're new to our wood-burning stove, but find that these fire-starters are a great aid.  They're easy to handle & work fast.\n",
      "We have a woodstove we have been buring for 6 years now - everyday in the winter - we have tried all different types of starters. I was skeptical of the price and size of these little starters - but going forward this is all we will be using. As long as you have a couple small sticks, well split logs or a little kindling (dry of couse) one is all you need to get a full fire going. Would definately recommend.\n",
      "My wife got some of these for me last winter but I just started using them recently. They work pretty good for starting fires, even with damp wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have not tried them on charcoal. Just wood fires.\n",
      "\n",
      "They light quickly and burn for maybe ten minutes. The flame is plenty hot enough to start even dampish logs.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if they would work for heating water up while hiking for a quick cup of tea. I might give that a try.\n",
      "These little gems start my fire pit wood very niceley.  Most of my pecan wood is 2\" diameter and I put two starters flat side up under my wood.  I then light the first one and let it burn about 5 or 6 minutes, and then light the second one.  It works great.  Most people who have problems have either placed them upside down or sideways.  Flat side up has never failed me.  Highly recommend.\n",
      "I can start the fire every time now! I love these, and what a good way to reuse something that would otherwise be wasted!\n",
      "These things work!  Easy to ignite, they burn HOT, hot enough and long enough to get dry logs of fair size to burn.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recommend this product to anyone who needs a fire and hates the idea of spending time turning logs into kindling.\n",
      "This is a great fire starter for the price.  They light easily and burn for a long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "We use them in our fireplace insert, and it doesn't leave any residue on the sides or bottom of the firebox.\n",
      "They work super.  You don't need a ton of kindling or newspaper to start a fire and there is so much less residue than we I used paper and kindling.  Great product!!!!  I have purchase 4 or 5 boxes of the fantastic starters over the past two years and they make it is easy to light a fire with no mess.  I would recommend them to anyone who has a fireplace, woodstove, or needs to start a fire outdoors or camping.  Since they are not subject to getting wet, they would be a great adjunct for hikers and campers or anyone that spend a lot of time outdoors,\n",
      "I grew up wadding old newspapers to start fires and chopping small bits of kindling... I can't believe how easy this makes fire-building! Our home is wood-heat only and it used to be a chore to build a fire and we would debate it if we weren't going to be home all day or awake too late because of the hassle. No more hassle!\n",
      "We're on our second year using the Lightning Nuggets to start fires in a fireplace insert, and they are great.  I build \"criss-cross\" style, putting 2 nuggets between kindling on the bottom, underneath the center piece of firewood in the 2nd layer, then put 2 bigger pieces of wood on top, lighting the nuggets and using tongs to place them before adding layers.  Close the door, and a few minutes later, the fire is blazing.  The nuggets last long enough to really get the fire going, Place them flat side up, simply light two spots on the sharp edge of each nugget.\n",
      "These lightning nuggets are great.  For the life of me, I cannot start a fire.  I purchased these after reading the reviews and so glad that I did.  I build my sticks and place these directly underneath.  They burn so hot that they really get the fire going.  Now I don't have to wait for my husband to get home to enjoy a nice warm fire!\n",
      "These are awesome!  They are small, and light immediately.  I'm always able to light my dry kindling or small wood with these usually with only one nugget - which is perfect.  Indoors or outdoors, I will be continually buying these for my fire-lighting use.\n",
      "My husband is sold on these little gems.  WE bought two varieties of starters and love them both.  Work great and doesn't take much to get the fireplace started.\n",
      "Of course all of you know about this product. Please read my review. All you have to do is put a match/lighter to the end of these half round fire starters and place them in your fire pit. They work great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "We tried many things to light fires in our wood stove before we found these and our search for the right fire starter is over. For small logs and chunks of wood you only need one but we find since our firewood is larger we generally need two.\n",
      "I started using these after I bought them from Lowes. One nugget does the job, Amazon sells these for a more competitive price than Lowes.\n",
      "These are hemispheres of glued sawdust that make lighting my firebox easy to start fires in.  They make my life easy.  And now I get them less expensively than from the factory and also free Prime shipping at Amazon.  My fires are burning bright!\n",
      "These are NOT easy to light, but their burning time once lit is quite impressive.  I bought for emergency use for which they are nearly perfect.\n",
      "I like these as they don't stink like the white cubes I used to use. They do take a minute with the lighter to get them started, but I think they work great compared to finding newspaper for the BBQ or starting the fire in the fire pit the old fashioned way.\n",
      "We love starting our woodstove with these.  It startes easier than paper & does not have as much ash as paper.\n",
      "These perfectly constructed nuggets make it easy for anyone to start a controlled fire in you home pit - good value!\n",
      "I am now a master fire builder after only 2 months of burning in a wood stove! I use one Lightning Nugget, 3 or 4 pieces of kindling, a small almond or madrone log and voila! I am retired and love the soothing heat of the wood stove this time of year on days that are 60 degrees of less outside. If we have another unseasonably sold winter this year I feel confident that my wood stove will keep us warm. I did try a box of Fatwood and prefer the Lightning Nuggets because they last longer and do not produce the heavy black smoke that the resin on the fatwood did. Happy fire building folks!\n",
      "I have used about a third of these nuggets so far.  They light quickly and burn long enough to get most wood burning on its own.\n",
      "They don't give out any smell, are non toxic, and are easy to store near the fireplace.  Not having to roll newspaper or use a lot of small pieces of wood has been wonderful.  Less clutter by the fireplace.  I do think they should be a bit larger. Using two instead of one will get the fire going for sure.  The quantity in the box is sufficient for a winter or two.  I would recommend this product.\n",
      "I tried \"Fatwood\" fire starters, and these Lightning Nuggets are MUCH better. What they are is hemispheres of sawdust impregnated with paraffin wax. (I think of them as \"sawdust macaroons.\") They light easily and burn a long time, so with a little kindling, they're all you need to get a fire going. Our house is heated entirely by a wood stove, so a quick and convenient way to get the fire started is a must. Newspaper works, but it's messy, relatively bulky, and it's a bother to keep enough on hand if you don't subscribe to a newspaper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lightning Nuggets are a perfect shape, too. I use them by lighting one and setting it flat side up in my stove. Then I build a little \"teepee\" of kindling around the burning nugget. The nugget holds the kindling up in the teepee shape so it can get air, and without any waiting I can just keep piling progressively larger pieces of wood onto the fire, up to full-sized logs.\n",
      "Yes, I feel like a cheater. But these little nuggets do make the morning stove fire so much easier to start up. They don't smoke up either so we burn them a minute to warm the pipe before adding kindling to avoid the backflow of smoke.  We do light all our fires with a simple propane torch so I can't speak to how easy they light with a match.\n",
      "These nuggets work like a charm.  No offensive odors or chemicals, stay lit and light the fire every time, even with wet wood!\n",
      "I get this for two things. reliability as it always works and last very long with each one. That is why this is the second one I purchased\n",
      "We have a pellet stove and the electric igniter failed so we tried some firewood starter sticks we've used successfully with our outdoor fire-pit but they didn't work well at all for this purpose. We broke them into a few small 2 inch sticks, then half buried them into a little pile of pellets, lit them but they just burned out and didn't light the pellets unless we positioned a pellet or two just right to hopefully ignite. Unbelievably we learned that pellets don't want to light easily even when holding a butane lighter to them for a few minutes or burning newspaper or paper towels under them. Fortunately, the nuggets seem to work much better as they simply stay lit longer and even when up against and slightly below the pellets which gives them a greater chance to actually light one little pellet. We also ordered some starter gel that arrived a few days after the nuggets. Wow, it lights the pellets instantly so we haven't really used the nuggets much but have a case of them, \"just-in-case\" and of course we'll use these with our fire-pit too.\n",
      "these do not work as well as the wax based starter blocks that you break off in sections. You end up using more of these so you end up paying more for these.\n",
      "When trying to light a few seasoned logs in my fireplace, I have to use at least 2 or 3 of these along with my bellows. Because of this, I question their value compared to other types of starters.\n",
      "These all nature nuggets were introduced to me by my fireplace insert installers, and I have been using them ever since. They made firestarting easy for me, who never had a fireplace before. And they are safe for outdoor and indoor use.\n",
      "These are the perfect size and much more affordable than buying small starter logs.  Two pucks gets a good fire going easily!  I'll definitely be buying these again!\n",
      "These put out some decent flames, but they are very small. I personally prefer the Fatwood starters to get my fires going. These burn out too often before actually getting the fire burning in my wood stove. I often end up using 2 of them to get a fire going.\n",
      "I think these are the best product I've tried so far to start fires in our wood stove.  I don't want to try anything else.  Would recommend!\n",
      "Once they are burning these are great. I found it took 30 seconds with a propane lighter- too long! Now I use a sliver of fat wood. Light that instantly thenay it across the nugget. WHAMOO! Fire in the hole! Or a douse it with a little jellied alcohol starter to same effect. I love these but. Wish they were easier to light. I guess if they were they would burn up too fast - so its a trade off. I am ordering my second box of 100 now.\n",
      "It only takes one to start a fire. Place it next to kindling and paper. Once it gets going, add more kindling and then slightly larger pieces of wood. If you have a wood furnace or wood stove...or even have an occasional camp fire, give these a try. I think you will be very please.\n",
      "These little starters work fine for starting my woodstove.  No unburned residue, and far cheaper than the fatwood I had been using.\n",
      "Its true, only one nugget is all you need.  No need for kindling, you can use big blocks of seasoned split wood with one of these under, walk away and you will have a nice fire.  Great product.\n",
      "Well....having given this a 4 star rating...must say that it is because a smaller order of the same product from Duluth\n",
      "ignited much more quickly, substantially...perhaps more pitch.  I am hoping future batches will return to that level of inflammability.\n",
      "It is STILL the best first starter that I have used....and I recommend it!\n",
      "These golf ball size nuggest start fires very easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In years past, I had kept boxes of lumber scraps for kindling to use as a \"step 1\" to getting a fire going in my wood stove. However, now I just put the firewood in the stove, and then place one of these in with the wood and fire is going. I do not even use kndling any more.\n",
      "\n",
      "These burn very hot after you light them. I find that if I put the nugget in between two peices of firewood so that the flame will travel up through the wood while touching both peices of wood and the fire takes off. My son takes a few along on camping trips and works great for starting camp fires too.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are great. Can not go wrong for starting fires. No more need for paper or kindling scaps.\n",
      "I have a wood burning (what else?) fireplace that is fairly efficient, but it won't allow me to use a gas log lighter. I found these a couple years ago, and they work very well. They are easy to light and one almost always will start a fire. I have read some reviews where people said that they had to use 5+ to get a fire going, and I was puzzled. More careful reading revealed that they have log grates that hold the logs up in the air. I think their problem is that they do not have the nugget close to the firewood, and 3-5\" is a long way away. On my firebox, there is no grate, so the logs sit directly on the ashes. I put one log in back, then nestle the nugget and light it. I put another log in front, and one more on top. Close the glass door and I'm done. (BTW, when I say log, I mean a split log piece - but still a sizeable piece). This is one of my favorite purchases! One last thing: I do not use ANY kindling - Just three large pieces of firewood!\n",
      "It lights and is a good kindling starter, but its not a solid thing.  I thought it would be like a slice of a duralog, but it's much more fluffier, which is what I think the other reviewers were complaining about.  You need to get the kindling set up right with this.\n",
      "This is my favorite type of firestarter and we heat exclusively with wood. Just one nugget gets my wood stove lit off from cold. This price is a better value than the box of 350.\n",
      "Right now I'm sitting in front of a fire started with one of these jewels. Couldn't be easier.  No more hunting down newspapers or cutting up kindling. I've even given some to friends to try. One of the best purchases I've made. Be careful opening the box because there's a lot of sawdust created in shipping. But this is a great product\n",
      "i purchased this for use with my coal stove but cant give a good review for that. my husband starts it with a torch, but i did use them a couple of times when the coal was almost out, husband not home, and had to get coal fire going again with a low coal load and it worked. i tossed one on my coal as it was not burning well due to lack of coal, i added coal to the hopper as well,  this burned well for several minuits and everything went well.\n",
      "These fire starters work GREAT! I use two at a time and they burn for quite some time allowing the wood to catch and stay burning.  They do not smell which is wonderful.\n",
      "I bought these for use with my portable fire pit -- these starters work wonderfully.\n",
      "I usually use 2 nuggets for starting and some kindling.  Really don't need much kindling - if any at all.\n",
      "Highly recommend.\n",
      "We have central heat that we use to keep the house from freezing, but we use a wood stove to keep the house at a comfortable temperature. So from November to March we use it daily. I need something easy and affordable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've tried every starter out there. For a number of years, I used the little starter squares, but I had to use 4 of them to get a good fire started. My smoke detector is very sensitive, so I need the fires to start quickly and hot so that I get good ignition and little smoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the other starters, I had to use a lot of kindling and still got mixed results at times. With the Lightning Nuggets, I just need to use one and a few pieces of larger kindling to get the kind of fire I want.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nuggets do take a few more seconds than the square to initially catch, but once lit, they do exactly what the manufacturer says.\n",
      "\n",
      "I use well seasoned, split wood. I have not tried these with poorly seasoned or damp wood or unsplit wood.\n",
      "We love these-  They are great for starting fires!  A simple way to get it going!  I ttred them last year, and also bought a box for a friend who has a wood stove, too.  We both bought them again this year!\n",
      "light one nugget on fire with some kindling and viola! instant fire...no newspaper or fussing. I was happy. The nugget stayed lit for about 10 minutes.\n",
      "My all time favorite fire starter is \"strike a fire\" made by Diamond. They are giant match type sticks that you strike on the box. No matches needed, no newspaper and one stick burns for about 10 minutes...I bought those at walmart for $8 a box.\n",
      "The box is small but should last a long time. The price here is much better than at the hardware store. It arrived quickly.\n",
      "These guys work great. If you have good kindling, you only need one of these pieces. I have used fatwood sticks aslo, but they burn too messy for me due to the sooty resin smoke which usually collects on the glass door. Ordering my second box.\n",
      "We have had a woodstove for just a few months, but it was really getting old trying to start the fire with newspapers and small kindling.  I read the reviews for this product, and decided to try a box.  You just set a nugget in the center of your firebox and build a little rafter of twigs, small kindling around it.  Light the nugget, and let it burn 30 seconds, or until the entire nugget is aflame, then just let it connect with the kindling.  It works fine!  I really had my doubts, but it does work.  You just have to build the fire, like building any fire.  Start with small kindling and when you have a bed of coals - add a decent piece of wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well worth the cost and makes less of a mess than all those paper ashes!\n",
      "I just got these yesterday! I started a fire tonight. I poped two of these little nuggets in there and I had a fire going in no time. Great product.\n",
      "I don't understand the poor reviews here so I thought I would put in my two cents.  These work well IF you use them as directed.  Light and let burn until completely covered in flame before you add your wood.  To get the fire going quickly I use kindling as well, but in a pinch I have used these to start bigger logs on their own.  It just takes a bit longer to get a roaring fire, if that is your goal.  I don't know why others have had problems with lighting them ... again, read the directions and set them upside down (on the round side) and hold your flame to the edge.  They light quickly for me.  I used to use fatwood, and that works as well but I don't like the volumes of black smoke that come out of the stove when first lit with fatwood.  These nuggets seem to burn much cleaner.  I recommend.\n",
      "I couldn't get them to light even when I held a BBQ lighter to one for 2 minutes.  I guess I'll use the box they came in to start the fire :(\n",
      "Does not light as easily as other products.  Need 4 or 5 for 1 fire to start.  Overpriced for what I expected.  Went back to Duraflame firestart.\n",
      "<div id=\"video-block-R2HCLWQSH3AVIE\" class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block\"></div><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91ax0g7AidS.mp4\" class=\"video-url\"><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/01gsNrxQtUS.png\" class=\"video-slate-img-url\">&nbsp;These little nuggets create a tall flame, about a foot, as shown in this video.  They only last for a few minutes, and I found them easy to light.  The small size makes it easy to throw into the little crevices.\n",
      "Saw the high-reviews of this product, purchased it to start fires in my woodstove... not so much!!!  Ended up having to use 6-8 nuggets to keep it going long enough to fire the wood - they burned-out quickly, and didn't produce a strong enough flame to get firewood going (they're supposed to take the place of kindling) - and had to add newspaper and kindling to finally get things lit.  After using half the box over the week, when to HD and got the Duraflame starters... those have worked PERFECTLY!\n",
      "If they were cheaper they would get 5 stars. They are very effective. I use three bricks every time I light the fire and have never had a problem\n",
      "Forget the newspaper grandpa and get these little nuggets to put a flame in your fire. I pop them in my woodstove for a clean burning way to get kindling going and warm that flue right up. I'm getting hot just thinking about it. Could be used for survival/backpacking, chimeneas, etc.. too. Eco friendly and won't cause those DANGEROUS floating little pieces of flaming embers that newpaper does..nor the toxic fumes. So go ahead and light one up, I use these on every fire. Purchased the hundred count and saved alot over the 'local' mega-corporation hardware stores' prices on a dinky little bag that didn't last long.\n",
      "These little nuggets work great whether starting a fireplace, stove or campfire - no need for paper. I use two in the fireplace to get an even burn but one works fine for a campfire. Purchased December 2010, worked just was well as any past year.\n",
      "These did not provide a large enough flame to start a fire with regular size split logs. It is very easy to light kindling with them but I think ill stick with newspaper with that. I sell firewood and was hoping to resell to my customers but have decided not to, the wood I tried to start with these was very dry.\n",
      "These are great fire starters! Safe and very effective! They put out a good flame to help get your fire started. Much safer than using newspaper! I highly recommend this product!\n",
      "With no fumes and no waxy residue like other starters that i usually would break by hand into smaller pieces, these starters are unlike others I have seen.  They do a great job, light easily on the edge and have perfect shelf life even in an unsealed box.\n",
      "They also burn well, set between two medium or large logs with a smaller log on top you can light and forget.\n",
      "It is great at last to have a decent fire starter!\n",
      "I use them in our Lopi wood stove.  One fire starter (placed round side down) and stack the wood on top.  Sure fire every time.  I sometimes use two, but I doubt if I need to.  Clean burning, burns a long time, and is easy to ignite with one match.  I buy a box every winter.\n",
      "The firewood i got this year was apparently not very well seasoned.  When it finally lights, it hisses constantly and you can see the water coming out of it.  So starting fires has been difficult.  So i tried these nuggets and they are great!  Mind you, i still put down kindling and newspaper (just not that much newspaper), and set 2 half sphere nuggets towards the middle sides of the bottom logs.  I light a piece of paper and put it next to them, and once they light, things get going.  Definitely a great value, and great product.\n",
      "Takes three or more to start a fire without kindling wood.  For me the best use was to refresh a fireplace fire that went cold.  Just toss one into the coals and you be rewarded with a renewed bright fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Low cost solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use care when opening the box... it will be filed with loose waxy dust.  If this is for your home fireplace then open it outside and transfer the starter bricks to a decorative bucket or box.\n",
      "If you can't light a wood fire with one of these you may have other issues. I see some reviews state one of these didn't do it for their fire or they needed several. I've started fires in my stove and fireplaces for years with everything from newspaper to starter logs and these are the best bang for the buck I have ever used... period!\n",
      "\n",
      "I purchased these in November 2009 because I wanted to see how more than a few worked before I did a review. About half a box later I can state I have never been unable to start a fire using only one of these starters. I burn soft pine, and harder pine like Tamarack, and always use kindling and dry wood. If there is any downside to these it's you normally can't start one with a single match. I bought a case of disposable butane lighters so it's not a problem anymore. I have these starters and some lighters in the vehicles for an emergency fire. We live on the high desert of Idaho and weather changes are fast and brutal but I'm more than comfortable depending on these starters should I ever be caught away from home and need a quick fire. You can even cook, using one after another, if you're without dry wood. I used the bricks before and that's a real waste so if you know how to start a fire these are a fine investment. If you have paraffin wax and sawdust you can make your own... I'm just too old and lazy to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't mean to be rude but you must have some clue as to how to build a fire before you try using these starters. You aren't going to get far by lighting one and throwing several logs on it. The start of a good fire begins with building it correctly. Start by building it with dry kindling. Starting a fire without kindling is a tough chore when you can easily get some using a hatchet to split some of your small logs down into thinner pieces. Larger logs should only be used once the fire is hot and has a bed of coals. Using some dry split logs after the kindling starts is good because split logs dry faster inside, and have more surface area to expose to the flame, then those that aren't split.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't lay the kindling directly on the starter. Arrange the kindling a little above it and lay them like a series of X's so the flame can rise between several pieces of wood. You'll have a fire in a few minutes if the kindling is thin and dry. Once it starts add a few larger (thicker) pieces of kindling, then some split wood and when it's nice and hot add a small log then your larger pieces later. I added a pic of my fire if the words didn't quite explain it properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly... you should only burn wood that is properly cured. I buy my logs already cut so I usually let them cure outdoors for about 6 months before I split them and then they're inside for about a week before they hit the fire. Store your cut logs under some protection from the weather to keep them dry. Fresh cut logs should cure for about 1 year. I'm sure you already know that kindling is just slivers of wood off a log you get by cutting it down... a 4\" log cut into quarters is about right but don't use one with knots on it or it won't split easily. Cut up enough kindling for about 4 fires, keep it inside, replace it as you use it and you should always be able to start a fire quickly and easily.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the normal household wood stove or fireplace you really should be splitting anything over about 3\" in diameter. Most logs are about 6\" to 10\" and unless you have a bonfire going they won't burn very well and definitely can't be started with one of these starters. If you build your fire correctly you can light it with a single match... but this is a whole lot easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had another case in my Cart but the price just went up $4 to [...] while I was writing this review but it just dropped back to [...] which is about .25 each. The better deal is 350 at $59.97 + $7.99 shipping ($67.96 total) from an Amazon seller Bargain Outfitters for about .19 each... that's like getting  of a case of 100 free. That's a lot of starters so I just bought another case of 100.\n",
      "\n",
      "If these are any worse than those I purchased last year I'll update this review.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update 1/22/11... just used one from a new box I received a few weeks ago and it worked fine. I don't see any difference in the starters or their performance... unlike what another reviewer stated. I previously used Strike-A-Fire by Diamond and, again, these are hands down the best starters I have ever used and they are very cost effective.\n",
      "One nugget, a few pieces of kindling, 3 logs placed just right and you have a roaring fire in no time! Easy product that does what is says it will do  - start a fire.\n",
      "Got these to use to start our wood burning fireplace, and they work very well and we will continue to use them.\n",
      "Nice set of firestarters. I most often use one but sometimes 2, depending on how dry the wood is. Better than any other firestarters I've used.\n",
      "Bought these for our wood stove and one will get a nice hot fire started, so long as the wood is properly placed for maximum airflow. We use one with a bit of kindling or junk mail. Been using these for a few weeks now and only had to use 2 one time as the wood was considerably wetter & one didn't do the trick. They are roughly 1.5\" long half-circles and burn for approximately 10 minutes (in our stove, anyway). Very pleased with these and with the free shipping. Fire starters are hard to find in our local stores, especially for this price. Highly recommend!\n",
      "Last week we went to our lake cabin to relax for a few days and took the box of 100 Lightning Nuggets to start our fire in our Franklin Standing Fireplace. We used a local brand of presto-logs to build our fire and started by putting two logs with a seperation so as to put two nuggets between them \"one towards each end\". After taking the third presto-log of which we broke into six to eight pieces about 1 1/2 to 2\" thick we lit the two nuggets and as they started burning I then put the broken pieces of the third presto-log on top of the two logs standing on edge so the flame from the nuggets would start them on fire. In no time we had a nice cozy fire to sit by during a wet, windy day at the lake cabin watching the trees swaying with the wind and whitecaps forming on the lake.\n",
      "Nice product,I use it to start my fireplace. First time buyer so I tried one to start the fire then two then three,then four. I guess you could use one but four seems to get the job done quickly. For the money the box of one hundred works well for me. I would buy this again.\n",
      "Bought this box a year ago (January 2009) and they were excellent.  Just bought a new box and first thing, noticed they were different (lighter in weight and color).  And yes, the new nuggets were much worse.  I guess they changed the formula/ingredients.  They burned up quickly and didn't go a good job at all.\n",
      "These simply do not burn hot enough to ignite wood.  I've tried a couple of times with slightly larger than kindling pieces of wood (dried for 3 years).  When it didn't ignite them quickly, I kept feeding in nuggets (8-10 total each time).  It raises the wood to smoldering after about 10 minutes, but it never ignited.  When I then supplemented the nuggets with newspaper, the wood caught right away.  The flame coming out of these is simply not hot enough, not even as hot as that from newspaper.\n",
      "The Lightning Nuggets are excellent fire starters.  I usually use one of the nuggets, sometimes two depending on the wood I'm using.  But either way, the nuggets are quick and efficient at getting the fire going.  No need to mess with large fire logs, newspapers, etc.  Just hold a match to a nugget and they light up within seconds.  As a bonus, there are no chemicals or anything to worry about.  These are also excellent in the case of getting a fire restarted (after letting one go out overnight).  Highly recommended.\n",
      "Very cute little spreaders.\n",
      "My daughters loved these!!  :)\n",
      "just what you would expect.  Have held up fine - use, run in the dishwasher, even.\n",
      "These are so darn cute and way bigger than I anticipated. I love them!\n",
      "The little cheese spreaders a bigger than I thought they would be, which is good. They fit well in the hand and have a large enough surface for a nice size dollop of cheese. :) I hand wash mine. the paint is a bit messy looking but not bad. They are cute and I get a lot of compliments. We use them at the beach.\n",
      "I love them!\n",
      "Cute little flippy flops! Will go great for summer parties!\n",
      "This set is very bright and colorful. I haven't used it yet, but it seems well made.\n",
      "This are just adorable. Haven't used them yet but they look sturdy. Going to pair them with some fused glass cheese trays I made.\n",
      "These little spreaders are adorable.  The colors are bright and look great together.  The blades are not sharp (as they are not to be) but cuts through cheese just fine.  I had friends over last night and we had cheese and dips for appetizers and these were the hit of the night.  I hand washed them, as my last couple sets of spreaders I put through the dishwasher and color came off and looked horrible quickly.  I have not had some of this brand but just being careful I hand washed.  These will be used a bunch this summer as we entertain a bunch!  Can't wait until to,or row to use them again!\n",
      "Love them !\n",
      "Nice size--do just what they are suppose to do-spread cheese\n",
      "When I received this blanket and opened it, I was immediately disappointed. It was so thin I thought I could punch through the material and there was no way it would be warm. I was SOOOOO WRONG!. This is the softest, warmest, lightest blanket I have ever touched. WELL worth the money. It has become the family favorite blanket. Now I have to fight for my turn with it on the couch. Must have MORE. I was worried that the price was to high for a blanket so I shopped around. For the size and the quality of the blanket this is a VERY good price. I recommend this blanket to anyone! AAA\n",

      "The result of burning the fiber from this Ecuadorian blanket is \"a hard irregularly-shaped black bead\". That is the typical result of the test for an acrylic textile.\n",
      "For comparison a Peruvian blanket made of 55% alpaca and 45% wool is shown on the same test. The result is \"a black, hollow irregular bead that can be easily crushed into a gritty black powder. It is self-extinguishing, i.e., it burns itself out.\"\n",
      "As described on the document named \"The_Burn_Test_to_Identify_Textile_Fibers.pdf\" search for it.\n",
      "You can also search for videos about textile burning tests to identify fibers.\n",
      "The item is well made. It is soft and smooth to touch. Although is is thin it feels as warm as a cover twice its thickness. We need to see whether dog hair gets imbedded into it.\n",
      "This ice maker was rated at 5 stars so, we bought two - one for the office and one for home. The one at home worked well for 10 months and then the ice shovel broke. A piece of plastic that conected the shovel to the motor that rotated the shovel broke off. The shovel won't work so, no more ice. The part can not be bought so, as a result I am out the cost of the machine for a cheap piece of plastic. Remember, I said we bought 2 machines. The ice machine at the office made it 6 months before the exact same thing happened. This is the worst investment I have made in a long time. I have read the reviews of the other ice makers and there are others with the same complaint about other brands as well. My advice is don't buy this type of ice maker no matter who makes it.\n",
      "I got this ice because the one in the frig went out, and I had already repaired it once. This is a great product, I fill up the ice tray in the frig and for me, this system works great. This product is  very well made, and  I think  that it will serve me well for years to come. If you are looking for a small ice make buy with confidence.\n",
      "Lightweight yet surprisingly warm.  Took it to bed the first night, but ended up removing it as it was too warm!  It gets really good use as a cuddly TV-watching blanket.  I don't get the lady who has posted a one star review for each color, saying it is polyester.  Mine is alpaca!\n",
      "This blanket is not Alpaca, but some sort of polyester.  When I burned a few fibers, they turned into a little hard ball, not ash, and did not smell like fur or hair.  The description for this item is fraudulent. Amazon should ban this seller.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the blanket does not look like the photo. The photo has an appealing color variation that makes it look natural.  The actual blanket is entirely uniform in color.\n",
      "\n",
      "After going round&round with the website, I chose the option to call Amazon.  They answered quickly, and Melissa sorted out everything and sent me a return label, and the blanket will go back on Monday.\n",
      "Pay attention to the \"muted ochre\" brown/black description, which is correct, rather than the title description which states \"reversible throw blanket soft brown earth tone cream\". There is no cream color in this blanket whatsoever. The colors are muted and certainly not \"vibrant.\" When it states \"reversible\" it means it reverses to the same on the other side - it's woven. The title suggested to me that it reversed from the soft brown earth tone on one side to a cream color on the other side. It does not. Also note that the edges are not hemmed, they're stitched. If you need to return the blanket, the company does not refund the original postage and charges a 10% restocking fee. I am returning nonetheless as it does not work for the space intended. Also be forewarned that when you request return information from the company you will receive a snippy, poorly worded response, nothing that would encourage return business. Had the response been a bit more courteous, I may have considered placing another order for a different throw that would have better met my needs. Based on their response, I can assure them they will not be getting any further orders from me.\n",
      "I love my Alpaca blanket.  It's as cuddly off the animal as on.\n",

      "I can't wait until a 3D printer can print one of these that can be washed.\n",
      "I've been using this Ice Maker for over a year now and is still making great ice just like the day I received it.\n",
      "The unit is on the large side however it was worth finding the counter space seeing how well it works.\n",

      "The worst, broke down ,always trouble, rip off!!!!'\n",
      "Great product! We use this product at one of our locations and it has been working in perfect order. Although there is no freezer to keep the ice frozen continuously I have never had a problem. There is always a full ice tray and the ice is soft but firm enough for drinks.\n",
      "This ice maker is nice looking and well made, but I didn't understand how cumbersome it would be to use it. We live in a southern state and it needed constant cleaning to insure no contamination or bacteria. We finally gave it away because it was simply too hard to keep clean and maintain. In fairness, we probably would have had this issue with any portable ice maker. We had no problem with it performing as described; we simply underestimated the issues associated with portable ice makers in general -- something not highlighted in product descriptions.\n",
      "In being honest, it had been a great investment up until about the 11th month. It was under warranty for a year, and did have a couple issues with the machine. Replacement part was shipped along with detailed instructions to handle the repair myself.(not fun, but do-able). Had an issue not long after that, same deal sent parts instructions, did not fix. I was sent a prepaid shipping label, and returned it. (SAVE YOUR ORIGINAL BOX IF POSSIBLE!!! Tough size to find!) After it returned a sensor went out, the part also did not fix. I was in contact with customer service through this whole event it was always the same woman. She sent a replacement icemaker out and asked me to box the old one up and ship back with a pre paid label. My new ice maker arrived yesterday, old is boxed and waiting for Fed Ex to P/U tomorrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I did experience some issues, I give HUGE Kudos to customer service, as it is nearly NON existent nowadays. It was a small inconvenience, but this icemaker is put to work 7 days a week, and has saved me a FORTUNE at the store, along with the convenience  of stocking up or make as needed. I clean it weekly with water and lemon juice or vinegar, and use distilled water. The resulting ice is consistent and crystal clear! It will make more ice than I can store in a day in one gallon freezer bags.\n",
      "\n",
      "Short of the long. While the product may not have been flawless (nothing is) I am not very tolerant to this type of situation, customer service IS THERE!!! They stand behind their product! Therefore The five stars. They clearly must understand it is not just a $39.99 purchase and oh, well sucker. Save your warranty info, and all the contact info is on the back page. I have bought other ice makers that did not last 3 months for close to the same price, knowing they stand behind their product and correcting it has sold me, now if more companies has the same policies it would make the world right!\n",
      "I've only had this icemaker about a week so far, but have to say I'm very impressed with it.  It keeps my little ice chest full for trips down to the creek with my dog and a cool beverage in the hot afternoons.  That saves me a ten mile round trip to the small local store where they charge 3 times the price for a bag of ice than in the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following up on my initial review approx. 8 months later it has died, so I'm lowering my rating from 4 stars to 2.\n",
      "This icemaker is well built and cranks out the ice. It makes some noise but is minimal. Having 3 different ice size options is great.\n",
      "...When you can make your own ice! In the house or in the car...absolutely great product to keep your drinks cool and travel long distances without fear of seeing your food spoil, because you can exchange the ice in your cooler as needed.\n",
      "I bought this to use in my garden party patio and NOT indoors. The insulation helps this perform in heat where others that are not insulated fail. The large ice cubes are really large compared to another brand I purchased before. I highly recommend. I gave it 4 stars because it has 3 design improvements or flaws. Having owned a restaurant in the US and understanding the food hazard and safety precautions for ice...it needs some improvements. One, having to remove the ice basket with your hands to refill...if instead it had a little tube and spout to pour into...that would eliminate the hand carried bacteria hazard. Next, a slot or notch that the ice scoop could fasten to to keep the handle from falling over into the ice thus contaminating it. Last, the lid should lift backward just 2 degrees more to prevent it from wanting to \"fall down\" while you are in the middle of scooping ice. Otherwise...a 5 star product.\n",
      "MY UPDATE AFTER THREE YEARS OF SERVICE... (Highly Recommended!):\n",
      "\n",
      "I purchased this Sunpentown Ice Maker through Amazon on August 26, 2011. I wonder why several people have reported machines with marginal reliability and broken parts after only a few months? Hard water? Maybe that's the key, use soft water like I do. It's easier on the parts. :)\n",
      "\n",
      "But seriously, I have had the Sunpentown IM-101S for just over THREE YEARS now. During that time it has not just sat around doing nothing. We have a family of five who use it 24/7. Our ice maker is never unplugged and never turned off. I originally bought it to fill in when the ice maker in our refrigerator broke. Although I knew I'd fix that one eventually, I wanted a spare ice maker since our family hates being without ice. After repairing the ice maker in our refrigerator, we decided to make THAT ice maker the backup for the Sunpentown. There are two reasons for that: ONE, the Sunpentown makes more ice than the refrigerator ice maker. TWO, the refrigerator ice maker can be turned off for long periods of time without getting dusty or smelling funny.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ice maker in the refrigerator only gets turned on once-in-a-while when we have company or when it's a really hot summer and we need extra ice. Other than that, the Sunpentown is our ice maker of choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "FINALLY - Just last week (October 5, 2014), after THREE YEARS of use, there was a failure. Yes folks, the machine broke. But this is a story with a good ending! The failure was easy to diagnose, easy to fix and very inexpensive. What failed? The plastic rotator pin on one end of the water tray that goes into the motor broke off. That meant the water tray would not rotate. The digital screen gave an error message saying that the \"ICE SHOVEL CANNOT ROTATE\". Although an accurate statement, it's not really the problem. The shovel is just the floppy plastic scraper attached to the front of the water tray. The reason the shovel cannot rotate is because THE WATER TRAY CANNOT ROTATE. Therefore, the part to order when you get this error is the WATER TRAY, not the ice shovel. Sunpentown sells the water tray for only $20 plus shipping (and tax if you are in California). I ordered two just to have a spare.  They arrived just three days after I placed the order.\n",

      "Using those instructions, it took just a Phillips screwdriver and 15 minutes to disassemble the machine. While I had it apart, I took the opportunity to clean the dust bunnies out and look over the inner workings of the machine. I am an aerospace manufacturing engineer, so I understand machines. Except for the plastic water tray, this is a pretty robust machine. Like a refrigerator, the cooling system should last for many long years. Keep in mind that even very expensive refrigerators use generic plastic ice makers that tend to need repair or replacement every two or three years. That puts this Sunpentown ice maker right on part with your expensive refrigerator.\n",

      "I reassembled my Sunpentown IM-101S ice maker in about 20 minutes (I took time to Loctite some of the sheet metal screws because they are pretty loose). My ice maker is now back up and running just fine and once again has become our main ice maker. I turned off the refrigerator ice maker to save for future emergencies.\n",

      "I waited three weeks for this review to give legitimate feedback on how my family likes it. Granted, that does not cover how LONG it lasts, but I didn't want to wait 6-months to a year to write the review.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the recommended initial cleaning procedure had us creating good smelling / tasting ice in just a few hours. We have run it non-stop for three weeks since then. We are a large family who loves ice in our water and sodas, so we keep it working full time. We also have a side-by-side refrigerator with ice in the door. It never made ice fast enough for us. Now we use them both, and the new SPT ice-maker helps us keep the fridge ice maker topped off.\n",
      "\n",
      "The noise of the machine while making ice is not a problem for me. It's louder than our fridge, but I only hear it when I'm in the kitchen. It's not so loud that you can't talk over it, and it doesn't detract from watching TV in another room. So noise is a non-issue. One funny side note: The first few times it \"dropped ice\" into the baseket, I thought someone was in my kitchen and went to look. It makes quite a racket! But it's only a few seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "This thing is BIG! It takes up as much room on a counter as a microwave, but it's taller. You have to have enough clearance above it to get the ice door open. Be sure to measure where you will place it before buying it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love the way the black and stainless unit looks in our kitchen. I am SO glad we did not opt to buy a cheaper white unit. That would have looked out of place.\n",
      "\n",
      "We do have a CON, but it's not a defect, and it doesn't stop us from loving the machine: Because it's basically an ice chest, not a freezer, it does not keep the ice frozen. That is pretty well documented throughout other reviews. However, on a hot or humid day, even if you use ice that has just dropped, it's a bit soft, or wet, and it melts quickly in a drink. When drinking water, I like that. When drinking soda, I do not. We have just learned to work around that by using ice from the fridge ice-maker for soda. Another minor issue related to this: If you use ice from the SPT to top off the ice-maker bin in your refrigerator, the wetness of the ice will cause it to immediately clump together, then freeze into a large lump. To get around that, just stir them up with a butter knife or some other blunt object as soon as you pour the ice into the bin.\n",
      "\n",
      "We do like and RECOMMEND this machine - a lot. Just be aware of it's size and the fact that you don't get rock hard ice from it.\n",
      "This machine is wonderful, however it took me two machines to find that out. The smell in the machine when you first get it horrible. You absolutely must clean the machine using the cleaning cycle at least 10 times before you use the ice from it. On my first machine I used the cleaning cycle 3 times and still did not get rid of the odor (which permeates your ice, by the way). I finally had to use straight white vinegar in the cleaning cycle to get the odor out. On top of that, I used an air purifier aimed directly into the machine for several hours. That put a high ozone content in there to eat up the chemical odor that is in the plastic. I finally have a machine that works.\n",
      "Works great, makes plenty of ice. Just clean with vinegar or bleach and water, and flush out with clean water. You'll have all the ice you want in no time at all.\n",

      "The unit is still working just fine! Not any problems whatsoever. It is still being used daily for 16 or so hours per day, 7 days per week.\n",
      "After reading the reviews for this product, I followed their advice.  It worked perfectly and simply and is a wonderful product.  At the moment I am using it at home since I've had loads of company, but my intent is to donate it to my church.  After using it here and seeing how convenient it has become, I will probably order another one for my use here at home.  I felt comfortable ordering it through Amazon because I've had nothing but good results in the past.  It's a great product - I'd recommend it to anyone.\n",
      "We have had several ice makers over the past few years. They were all inefficent,had mold build-up in them and lasted barely a year,The Suppentown ice maker is terrific in every way. I heartily reccomend it.\n",
      "I decided to purchase this afer reading the positive reviews on this icemaker. I do like the cleaning feature and yes, it does make ice very quickly! The only downfall is that this icemaker does NOT stay on..after making batches of ice, it turns itself off and you have to turn it back on EACH time you need more.  The review that stated that this icemaker will run all day and night by itself stopping and starting as needed when the ice melts is definitely NOT true. When the bin is full, the LCD display doesn't even light up to show that either.  I called a rep and was told that once it makes ice, it will turn itself off (which is contrary to what the review states) each time. Even if you take ice or empty out the bin while it's still on, it doesn't keep making more ice and will just shut off even if you still have enough water to make more ice. I then emailed them to inquire about the LCD indicator not displaying and other issues but it's been a week and I still haven't gotten any response from Sunpentown, an indication of poor customer service! You may want to consider purchasing another Brand, which would do the same thing except for the cleaning function at a much cheaper cost. For the price of $244.54, it is pretty steep for what I expected.\n",
      "This is my second ice maker as the first one was NewAir sold through Amazon. That was returned because it was damaged inside. But I had ordered this one to replace it right away. This one is a bit louder with the FAN. But the ice is plenty that is made from it. So much I had to give the rest to the dogs. When you get this you have to clean it. I use the clean cycle that is programmed into it. First I add 1 cup of lemon juice with 4x 4 cups of water or until it fills. Run the clean cycle then when finish drain out the water. Then fill it up again with just clean water only. The run the clean cycle again. Once that is finished drain all the water out. Now your ready to use the ice maker. I say every 5 days run the clean cycle or when you're not using the ice maker for long periods of time.  Then repeat the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "This unit uses 2 more cups water than the New Air model did. Frankly I just wanted a unit to make the ice as the Whirlpool side-by-side refrigerator ice maker had stopped working. I didn't feel like to spend up to $100 or more bucks in parts just to wait 24 hours to make 12 cubes of ice. So now I can get 12 cubes of any size small, medium or large in just 6 minutes. It the unit is huge but will fit on any counter space you got. Now what I do is just make enough ice to fill the extra large ice storage box in the Whirlpool since that dispenser for ice still works for cubes or crunched ice. Anyway I use filter water from the tap water to make the ice. So the water I use to drink is the same water that is filtered by PUR is what's on the sink tap and the Whirlpool 3 & 6 stage. Anyway if you want a very good ice maker this one is the way to go!\n",
      "Yes, filling ice cube trays.  What a joy.  Fill the tray, walk to the freezer, put tray in freezer. Repeat.  Wipe water off of floor and feet from the water that decided it didn't want to remain in the ice cube tray.\n",
      "Enough of that!\n",
      "I was a bit skeptical about buying this unit, only because of reviews I have read.  Very mixed reviews.  People either loved it or thought it was junk.  I went to various department stores, just to examine some other models.  Then, I decided, and bought the Sunpertown.\n",
      "Although I've never heard of their name, I checked their website, and decided to give it a shot.  What's in a brand name these days?  Heck, a few years ago most people had never heard of LG.\n",
      "I must say I am extremely pleased with the unit.\n",
      "Does it make ice?  Yep, and very quickly.  I leave my unit on all the time.  I purposely did not use any ice one day to see how many cycles it ran on 'it's own' and how fast the ice melted.  I was impressed that it only had to run 3 times in one day.\n",
      "Obviously, it runs more often when ice is being used.  It does an excellent job.  Regardless of other reviews, there is a difference in size between the small, medium and large sizes.  The large cubes melt the slowest, so that's the size I generally use.  If you need ice for mixed drinks, the small size is easier to crush.\n",
      "The unit is built sturdy, is visually appealing (although a few friends have insulted me because they thought it was a breadmaker...LOL)\n",
      "\n",
      "Does this unit make a lot of noise?  Well, the fan makes the most noise, but it is less of an irritation than the sounds of a microwave oven.\n",
      "It is, unbelieveably, very energy efficient for this type of appliance.\n",
      "My microwave uses five times the power.\n",
      "So, in closing, I highly recommend this product if you are thinking of an icemaker.\n",
      "Some advice if you are thinking of buying one of these:\n",
      "\n",
      "First, go buy a bag of ice at the store for $2, see how long it lasts, and ask yourself if you really need an icemaker for $200.  That's a lot of bags of ice, and you still have to pay for electricity and fill it up and clean it!  If you can get by with a $2 bag once or twice a month for 5 months out of the year, this may not be the product for you!\n",
      "\n",
      "We decided on this one because it looked like the best one after looking at the comments of other reviewers.  We noted that ice makers in general have a pretty high breakdown rate, and so for the first time in my life, I actually bought an extended warranty that all consumer magazines tell you are a waste of money.  We'll see.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you buy it, while it's on its way, go buy a quart size container of vinegar.  The plastic smell this thing generates when you first get it is pretty strong.  That's just the smell AROUND the unit when it's on, I didn't even bother tasting the ice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dump the vinegar and an equal amount of water in it and press the self clean button.  Run it twice then as it makes ice, throw the ice out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now you have a second problem: the vinegar will smell even though you got rid of all the ice.  That's because there is 4 cups of water left in the thing when it looks empty.  The only way to get rid of the 4 cups of vinegar-smelling water is to drain it using the drain on the lower left.  Fill it again, run it, toss out the ice, drain and repeat until the ice stops smelling like vinegar.  We had to run it through several times.  It took several days.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then: it makes ice.  Enough to fill 5 large ice tea glasses in about 3 hours.  As another reviewer noted, the ice stays in an insulated bucket with holes in it that sits above the water reservoir.  When the ice melts, the melted ice drips into the reservoir.  When the level of ice is less than full, it makes more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reviewer stating that he can't tell when it's on is absolutely nuts.  It sounds like a modestly quiet dishwasher in the rinse cycle.  You can tell when its on from 20 feet away.  It runs continuously until the ice bucket is full then stops and then it is silent until enough ice melts for another batch to be made to refill it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a fairly large appliance, but most of its size is dedicated to insulation that you WANT, so it's large in a good way.  13\" wide by 16\" high by 16\" deep.  About the size of a big office printer.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's more energy efficient than you'd expect.  It uses 2.4 amps to make the ice and 3.5 amps for the minute it takes when it's pushing the ice from where it gets made into the bucket.  2.4 amps x 120 volts means it uses about .290 kilowatts.  If you figure it runs about 4 hours per day, that's about 1.152 kilowatt hours per day, about 12 cents per day or $3.60 per month.\n",
      "\n",
      "A child can operate it.  Once it's set up, you just fill the tank with water (about 10 cups max), push a power button and it will run all day by itself, stopping and starting as needed to make more ice until you shut it off or it runs out of water.  They give you a shovel to scoop ice out of the basket, and the basket has handles s that you can lift the whole thing out and dump it into another container.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interior is made out of the same stuff any cooler is made out of and is easy to clean.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're happy with it.  If it breaks, I'll be back to report it and I'll also report whether the extended warranty was worth it or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: 4 years later, did it break?  No, because we never used it.  Arrrgh!  At least I didn't pay for it.  I rent extra office spaces and one of my tenants bought this thing after he said my ice tasted funny.  Never ever used it though. I think they thought it would be like an ice maker you get with a fridge.  This one takes actual effort: you have to fill it, drain it, clean it, etc. so they never used it after all my work cleaning it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me give you some good advice: buy 4 ice cube trays and put them in the freezer every night instead of cleaning this thing.  Then, in the morning, dump them into a gallon freezer zip lock bag and repeat.  It's easier, cheaper, costs little to do and you'll thank me in the end.  This was a complete waste.\n",
      "The design is clearly a scanned image.  They're fine to be used under a glass, but I wouldn't\n",
      "buy for their decorative value.\n",
      "\n",
      "Picture is much darker than the washed out version I received.b\n",
      "We bought these coasters thinking they would actually absord the condensation from our cold beverages.  Instead, the moisture merely pools on top of the coaster so that every time you pick up your glass it drips on the coffeetable, the floor, you.  They look nice but are not very useful.  Plus, one arrived broken; cracked into three large pieces.\n",
      "It's nice having a solid, sturdy coaster that won't stick to the bottom of your glass when you pick it up, and that won't soak through or create condensation where it shouldn't be.  That's what I really wanted from a coaster, and that's what I got, so I'm happy there.\n",
      "\n",
      "The print on it isn't as sharp and vibrant as depicted (it's obviously the print before it's been applied to the non-smooth surface of the coaster), and when I unpacked them my husband asked \"what's it supposed to be?  Nachos?\"  That's EXACTLY what it looks like - a macro shot of nachos.  So we call them the Nacho Coasters.\n",
      "Love the colors in these coasters! A bit more muted than in the listing photo (which is a good thing). Love them!\n",
      "First off, I have to say that the company that makes these is fantastic.  I had a problem with my order and they replaced the wrong ones with new ones and let me keep the wrong ones too.  Now, for the coasters, they are so absorbent.  We had glasses with ice on them for hours and it never soaked through the coaster.  Beware though, the image is misleading.  The print on the coasters is a little washed out looking, it is still really pretty but just not as vibrant as in the photo.  Great coasters, great company.\n",
      "So I got this for some random reason... can't really remember at this point.  But it's pretty cool!  The top of it is comfortable and smells nice.  It seems to be pretty sturdy but there is some cardboard in it which isn't too noticeable, but when I saw it I somewhat questioned the build quality...  Seems fine though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, nice floor mat to put below my Samurai swords and/or use as a platform for a bed(with a futon cushion) for any guests I might have.\n",

      "I'd buy another if I wanted to make into a queen size bed... :)\n",
      "I am very pleased with the Tatami grass mat floor panel  It arrived in record time and was just like it was portrayed.  It is very soothing to lay on.  The shipment was very fast and service was great.\n",
      "Not as expected.  The design is a print, not natural stone.  These coasters don't absorb any moisture so my table still gets wet when my glass sweats.  My set is also noticably unlevel, so my glass wiggles.  Do not buy these!!\n",
      "its nice and heavy\n",
      "Bought as gift when I saw my mom's old coasters were a little ruff for wear.  She likes these new ones and the coaster holder I also bought with it.  Nice little surprise gift that brightened her day\n",
      "These are just what we needed.  We had an old set that lasted for many years but had become chipped & discolored.  These are a great replacement!\n",
      "We had been using glass coasters.  With a little bit of sweat on the glass, they would stick to the glass when you picked it up.  These absorb any sweat from cold beverages and protect our leather end tables.  They are nice and heavy and clean easily.\n",
      "These thirstystone coasters are an awesome quality for the price.  We recently redecorated our living area and needed matching coasters.  These were just the touch!\n",
      "If there were a more realistic photo of the coasters displayed here, the ratings would be so much better.  The coasters themselves are great.  They work extremely well.  They're thick, and heavier than you might expect.  If you closed your eyes and held one, you'd be impressed.  The problem, as many others have mentioned here, is that the colors in this photo are much richer and deeper than the colors of the actual coasters.  The customer-submitted photo above does a better job of showing the actual printed design on the surface of the coaster.  I think many people would still purchase the coasters if an accurate representation of the product was provided, but in this case, what you see is not what you get.\n",
      "I got this for a present. When it arrived it was such cheap quality that I never gave it away. The color doesn't look deep and dark like the picture but red and flat. No one would ever mistake it for real stone. The sides of each thick coaster are not printed and look awful. It also didn't come with a holder for the coaster set. It arrived cracked and the first time I used it, it cracked again from falling off the coffee table. Do not buy, please!\n",
      "great for the price but be aware they are in fact NOT 6'x3' rather they are standard metric size 180x90 cm\n",
      "nice tatami matts for their price. can't do yoga on them though b/c it'll break eventually. we'll use them as a tea room matt.\n",
      "we had an issue with one that arrived damaged but service was prompt and they helped us with this issue.\n",
      "Do not leave it sitting around long or it will start to warp. It is extremely heavy. I bought it to make my platform bed more supportive. I've had it almost a year and it still has a bad fish odor, especially now that the weather is getting hotter. If you're strong enough to lift it and you don't mind the odor, it does provide support.\n",
      "Great its nice.\n",
      "There are a whole series of these sandstone coasters but I've discovered that the designed appears obviously printed and hence cheap.\n",
      "I was a little disappointed with the look of these coasters when I first got them.  In the picture they almost look like granite.  I was expecting a more shiny surface, but they have a dull, matte surface (probably for absorbing moisture).  After using them however, I was very pleased.  They are heavy and sturdy with a nice cork backing and they really do absorb water!  I was excited to see that they can keep up with a cold, iced beverage on a hot day.  We were previously using glass coasters and the water would pool up and run onto our coffee table, but not with these!  I completely recommend them.\n",
      "This coaster is very absorbent. It doesn't discolor very easily. It holds most any size glass. It protects your furniture from getting wet.\n",
      "The coaster set is OK but washed out and flat looking -- not anywhere as colorful as the picture.  Probably would not have bought it if I could have seen the set in person.  What happened to the \"Glow\"?\n",
      "These clear vinyl chair protectors are great for keeping spills off my upholstered kitchen chairs.  All three of my children have spilled at one time or another and there's no worries since it falls right onto these chair protectors.  I purchased our current ones about 9 months ago and unfortunately these don't last very long b/c they slip and slide when they move around getting up and down from their chairs and the plastic straps eventually tear off.  I do admit that they're not very attractive either but the upside is that my chairs have stayed looking brand new.  Every household with small children should invest in several packages!  Definitely worth the money.\n",
      "excellent tatami mat. no smell whatsoever. sturdy. great for my japanese futon\n",
      "i order a queen size and i received one that was smaller than a twin. very poor quality\n",
      "Using this as an accent piece in the living room, would work well if you wanted to do a larger installation of tatami in a room, which I thought about but maybe another day.\n",
      "definitely worth the money.\n",
      "Great coasters that really absorb all the moisture your glasses sweat on a hot summer day. The rest seem to stick and then fall off, not these.  The colors are very vibrant and look just like the ones on the computer.\n",
      "I purchased these coasters as a gift for my daughter-in-law who loves hummingbirds. I know she will like these; they are so pretty. The colors are vivid, they are a good weight, and I think my only complaint would be that they are larger than I imagined, but that's not really a complaint. I'm very satisfied with the quality.\n",
      "I was really pleased with the lock of these coasters.  They had a much more finished appearance than others I've seen and look very attractive on our end table.\n",
      "These coasters came as expected.  I've seen them in stores so I knew what they looked and felt like.  They are substantial in weight.  There is no holder for them.  It would look nicer if they were displayed in one of the holders made for them also available on Amazon.\n",
      "This mat has completed my \"zen room.\" The natural smell is great, and this mat is big enough to do yoga on as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was worried my cat would shred it, but she does not touch it.\n",
      "Finally I got this item. First of all I love the quality of the mat, but the size---way wrong! It's definitely a twin size. But because I bought this for my baby girl, so I think I will keep it. Was thinking about sleeping with my girl together...don't like be fooled to be honest! Shame about made in Japan...\n",
      "I spent a lot of time in old houses in Japan and wanted to tatami-fy my room when I came back.  First, I looked at tatami made in Kyoto by the real artisans. A real made-in-Japan tatami mat of equivalent size, hand-woven by artisans, costs more$1,000 per mat (and that excludes shipping costs). An American bedroom is usually more than 4 mats (usually 6-8 mats large), so it's very expensive to completely \"tatami-fy\" a bedroom. At $179, this \"cheaper\" version is not a bad substitute (and that price includes Amazon 2-day Prime shipping). It smells authentic (sweet tatami smell), feels authentic (firm yet slightly springy), and the stitching looks fine, although if you have kids or pets, or do any rough-and-tumble stuff on it, it will come apart, no surprise. This arrived safely and was well-packaged. It is very heavy and bulky (6 feet by 3 feet) so it helps to have 2 people move a single tatami mat around. I could not see where it is made on the packaging, I presume Taiwan or mainland China. However, few people in Japan can really afford artisan-price tatami anymore, and I'm sure their tatami is also made in Taiwan or mainland China, so I'm not crying. My only wish is that they should also offer it in different fabric borders. This one is a plain black canvas. In Japan you can custom-order your fabric border in different brocade patterns and colors (traditionally, of course, \"commoners\" were prohibited from using such patterns, which were reserved for temples and aristocrats).\n",
      "It arrived quickly. Though outside packaging looked like it took a mild beating.  The inner packaging was perfectly intact.  I let it air out - I for one do like the smell as it reminds me of Japantown in SF.  I use it under a 3\" gel mattress topper (twin size).  This is now my guest bed.  I am a bit envious as it is firm yet super comfortable.\n",
      "Well it arrived here quickly and with no issues! So happy about that.  But I've got one half of my queen sized foam pad on top of this tatami mat,  and the other half laying on the floor and I've been toggling which side I sleep on every few days... And well ...  I can't tell the difference.  People write on here that there's a slight give, but I don't feel it. The key to a Japanese bed is having a good pad, not so much the mat.\n",
      "\n",
      "FYI for a mat I use a 4in memory foam topper that I got at Costco a few years back.  I also have wooden floors, so I bet tile/concrete may be harder.\n",
      "It's a Tatami. It looks and feel like the Japanese ones. Sleeping on it is not for everyone. I've been tinkering with the thickness of the shikibuton (futon) for a while now. This is essentially like sleeping on hardwood floors with a slight more give. The first futon I bought was 3\", worked for a few weeks then my hips started hurting (I am a side sleeper). The second futon was 4\", worked for a few weeks then it was too hard. I've now put the first futon underneath the second and at 7\" it works for me. Now my concern is, with 7\" of padding what do I need this tatami for? A piece of plywood on my bed-frame would probably do the trick. Maybe not. We'll see.\n",
      "One came obviously damaged by forklift carelessness, was happy that the replacement came promptly and perfectly intact! These mats are sturdy with just the right amount of play for a gentle surface and look fantastic!\n",
      "Beautiful, sturdy, nice smelling, fast shipping, great price. What's not to love?\n",
      "keeps spills off but awkward to place on chair\n",
      "I have a son with autism. My furniture takes a beating and gets ruined within days if I don't protect it somehow. I loved a dining room set I saw, but was afraid to purchase it for fear it would get ruined. But thankfully I saw these protectors online! I was able to get the dining room set of my dreams and not worry about it getting ruined. I really like its simple style, and how it doesnt draw attention to it.\n",
      "Just what we needed for new dining chairs.\n",
      "Keeps cats off and fabric protected.\n",
      "super nice keeps the seat clean when being used by sloppy kids!\n",
      "I had to cut the both sides to be able to tie around my chair cause no way it could tie to the back of the chair.\n",
      "Didn't work for me. Product doesn't lay right, tie backs look tacky, hot to sit on. Just make sure you really want this product as it is NOT RETURNABLE.\n",
      "Have one under the futon in my living room, and one under the bed in my bedroom. Happy with both, full support with just the right amount of springiness. Longevity I am not sure about yet as they are only about six months old, but so far so good. As to that grass smell that some are complaining about, really? A fresh set of dried hay was what it reminded me of. Nothing to the sort of rotting or anything, just cut dried hay, and to me that is a great thing. When I vacuum between the mattress and the platform I still get a bit of the smell of hay. Loving these and thinking of getting four more for the other beds in our home. Well made, well done! Thank you Oriental Furniture for the great product!\n",
      "Good deal. Thanks\n",
      "This was my bed while I was taking courses for 6 months. I loved the firmness of the mat (with the slight give) straight on the floor and it did wonders for my back pain. In the future I will put it on a oriental futon frame. Great on it's own -- I never had a futon on it!\n",
      "Still using these today\n",
      "So far I love the Tatami Mat even though the price was a wee bit steep in my opinion. It did take some time getting use to sleeping on it even though I have about a 1.5 inch wool mattress pad over it and sheets. I can tell that my back issues are improving significantly as time goes and I hope that this tatami mat last me a long time. The king size tatami mat fits a standard twin xl bed frame snuggly.\n",
      "I had gotten rid of a platform bed which was too high.  I am short and it got to a point that  I would need a step stool to get on our old bed.  Had purchased a different type and look like it was in a so many pieces and didn't have the time to put together, so I sent it back.  Then I was browsing on Amazon and saw reviews on this, which helped me greatly and purchased this (2 for king size bed mattress) platform.  It was just the right height to put my humongous mattress on and it worked out great!  It does make a difference having this for your platform.  Does make sleeping and mattress better.  Good quality, delivery was great.  The 2 inches along with my mattress height is perfect now!  I would definitely buy this again!\n",
      "Very sturdy and well made. Exactly what I expected. I purchased 2 for a queen sized bed platform. Just what I wanted.\n",
      "Prior to buying these, we were concerned about whether or not these are the \"real thing\" or not.  I lived in Japan for 6 years and really enjoyed this type of flooring.  I bought 4 of these and put them together in a section of the family room and it is now the focal point of the room.  These are very reasonably priced as well.  We are glad we bought them!  My wife is Japanese and she feels very \"at home\" with them too!\n",
      "works\n",
      "Covers well\n",
      "I ordered this based on the positive reviews but it just wasn't for me.  I'm accustomed to a very plush pillow-top mattress so when I slept on a thin futon-roll on top of this (after a move, where I couldn't take my previous bed/mattress), it was just too much of an adjustment.  I tried it for 3 weeks but never managed to adjust.  It would probably work for you if you like a really firm mattress or like sleeping on the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the smell, it didn't bother me at all.  I actually kind of liked it.  Very earthy.  It dissipated after just a few days though.\n",

      "\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "-Absolutely gorgeous, high-quality materials and an even color.\n",
      "-The smell is wonderful! A cross between fresh earth and the natural materials used in the construction. I want to cut up the boxes and use them as air fresheners in my closets.\n",
      "-Absolute comfort. Everyone who has taken a seat on the mat has immediately laid down and remarked on how they'd enjoy sleeping on the surface. It is very firm, but forgiving in just the right way.\n",
      "-Relaxing. My wife and I were nearly lulled to sleep when we sat and laid down to test the new mats.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "-Slight cosmetic damage to edges during shipping. Hard to fault the seller since this is such a hard item to ship, damage does not hinder performance. If I could pick this up in person I would. Product was shipped in two overlapping boxes, about all the protection possible without increasing shipping cost.\n",
      "-There is a definite (though wonderful) smell. I could imagine people with very sensitive allergies having trouble with the smell, although I personally have suffered from seasonal allergies and hay fever and the like for my whole life, and I have absolutely no trouble with this product.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got two mats to test out the dimensions in my room, products were as advertised in all respects. I am definitely going to get the additional two and a half mats I need to complete the \"idea\" Japanese tearoom layout. Outstanding product, quality craftsmanship. Please support this excellent company.\n",
      "Although the text describes this mat as  hypoallergenic, as soon as I opened the shipping carton I began to sneeze.  However, I let the mat air out for a few days and then used it on the daybed in my living room.  It's perfect as a support for a futon and my next guest (who doesn't have the same allergies) thought it was great.\n",
      "ok - we hated our bed. had a mattress and a box spring hated it. My boyfriend has a herniated disk in his lower spine and read that Japanese mattress are the best for body support. he bought one of these in a twin size and was sleeping on the floor for years - well I wanted him back in the bed so I shoved out about $1000 for this whole set:\n",

      "I bought these covers to protect new kitchen chair cushions from the messes my 2-yr old grandson makes.  There's no real way to fasten the covers to the chairs, though, but they drape nicely over the cushions and protect very well.  They're easy to remove, so they're perfect protection for cushions during parties or celebrations. They do what they're supposed to. No complaints.\n",
      "I purchased 1 pair of chair protectors. I love it. It is heavy and crystal clear. The best I like is there are two ties that you could fasten the covers.\n",

      "A little small towards the back, but I made it work.\n",
      "This is the second time we have ordered these chair covers.  They work great over our kitchen and dining room chairs.  We had problems with cat hair and food stains on the fabric but no longer have the problem.  The Vinyl covers are easy to wipe off.\n",
      "This is very pretty and has a pretty small footprint. It's counter-worthy. I have never used this so I can't comment on its performance.\n",
      "I purchased one of these 5 years ago used (5 years old at the time) and I finally had to replace it a year ago. I purchased this one for my daughter. a GREAT little machine!\n",
      "NOTE: I actually purchased the IM-101S, but it is the identical machine inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "PLEASE DO NOT LET OTHER POOR REVIEWS TURN YOU AWAY FROM AN EXELLENT MACHINE!\n",
      "\n",
      "I purchased my IM-101S Sunpentown Ice Maker through Amazon on August 26, 2011. I wonder why several people have reported machines with marginal reliability and broken parts after only a few months? Hard water? Maybe that's the key, I use soft water. It's easier on the parts. :)\n",
      "\n",
      "But seriously, I have had the Sunpentown IM-101S for just over THREE YEARS now. During that time it has not just sat around doing nothing. We have a family of five who use it 24/7. Our ice maker is never unplugged and never turned off. I originally bought it to fill in when the ice maker in our refrigerator broke. Although I knew I'd fix that one eventually, I wanted a spare ice maker since our family hates being without ice. After repairing the ice maker in our refrigerator, we decided to make THAT ice maker the backup for the Sunpentown. There are two reasons for that: ONE, the Sunpentown makes more ice than the refrigerator ice maker. TWO, the refrigerator ice maker can be turned off for long periods of time without getting dusty or smelling funny.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ice maker in the refrigerator only gets turned on once-in-a-while when we have company or when it's a really hot summer and we need extra ice. Other than that, the Sunpentown is our ice maker of choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "FINALLY - Just last week (October 5, 2014), after THREE YEARS of use, there was a failure. Yes folks, the machine broke. But this is a story with a good ending! The failure was easy to diagnose, easy to fix and very inexpensive. What failed? The plastic rotator pin on one end of the water tray that goes into the motor broke off. That meant the water tray would not rotate. The digital screen gave an error message saying that the \"ICE SHOVEL CANNOT ROTATE\". Although an accurate statement, it's not really the problem. The shovel is just the floppy plastic scraper attached to the front of the water tray. The reason the shovel cannot rotate is because THE WATER TRAY CANNOT ROTATE. Therefore, the part to order when you get this error is the WATER TRAY, not the ice shovel. Sunpentown sells the water tray for only $20 plus shipping (and tax if you are in California). I ordered two just to have a spare.  They arrived just three days after I placed the order.\n",

      "Here is the website for the Ice Maker parts:\n",
      "http://www.sunpentown.com/paacforicema.html\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are instructions for replacing the water tray complete with step-by-step pictures:\n",
      "http://site.sunpentown.com/IM-100.101_watertray.pdf\n",
      "\n",
      "Using those instructions, it took just a Phillips screwdriver and 15 minutes to disassemble the machine. While I had it apart, I took the opportunity to clean the dust bunnies out and look over the inner workings of the machine. I am an aerospace manufacturing engineer, so I understand machines. Except for the plastic water tray, this is a pretty robust machine. Like a refrigerator, the cooling system should last for many long years. Keep in mind that even very expensive refrigerators use generic plastic ice makers that tend to need repair or replacement every two or three years. That puts this Sunpentown ice maker right on part with your expensive refrigerator.\n",
      "\n",
      "I reassembled my Sunpentown IM-101S ice maker in about 20 minutes (I took time to Loctite some of the sheet metal screws because they are pretty loose). My ice maker is now back up and running just fine and once again has become our main ice maker. I turned off the refrigerator ice maker to save for future emergencies.\n",
      "I was fairly anemic for a couple of years and luckily my cravings were limited to ice.  My refrigerator's icemaker couldn't keep up, as well I wanted smaller cubes.  I researched several of these machines at various sites and liked what others had to say about this one.  I purchased it on Amazon and I'm happy to say that it was well worth the money.  I experienced no problems at all (leaks, mechanical or otherwise).  It also wasn't very noisy... much less noise than I expected.  It's a bit heavy but once I placed it on the kitchen counter there was no need to move it.  The only disadvantage I can even think of was having to fill the reservoir.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm no longer anemic but have stored it with care in the basement in case its needed in the future.  I give this one 5 stars.\n",
      "I live in remote rural Alaska.  Now, one would think, with snow 8 months out of the year, why would I need an ice maker!  Oddly enough, unless you make your own ice cubes, there are none to be had here.  I like to make snow cones in the summer for the kids in the community and this little unit does the job.  Yes, it's noisy..but I have been running it one or two days a week, filling large zip-lock bags with ice cubes and keeping them in the freezer until needed.  Works perfectly for my needs!\n",
      "I bought this icemaker with high hopes that it would make ice quickly. Well, it takes forever to make a load of ice...and don't even think it will be anything like the picture. It won't make anywhere near the amount that appears to be there. That is a tray with the ice in it...and a very small tray at that. This might go well with very small scale requirements...on the scale of an \"easy bake oven\".\n",
      "\n",
      "When it does make the ice, you'd better get it out quickly or it starts melting and it all sticks together. It absolutely does not stay cold enough to hold the ice you make. It will start melting quickly...actually as it's making more...then start another cycle. Seriously, with having to fill this thing with water and having to be right there when it's done to collect the ice...it's much easier and more economical to just ride down the hill and get bagged ice. Plus it mixes water with your ice so the ice you get is really wet ice...and I mean water drips everywhere inside this thing continually.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok...all of that negative talk pertained to the machine when it worked. It totally quit working after about 2 months. Well, it does still make a little noise but nothing happens. It was too late to return it and way too much trouble so I will can this garbage. Don't buy this machine. There are much better units out there for the same money or less.\n",
      "This is a replacement for a Supentown icemaker exactly like this one.  The only difference is the led display.  The last one was in use continuously for 8 years. It sat on a counter at my real estate office with absolutely no trouble-- ever!!  A change in water service put a lot of dirt in the lines that killed the machine.  This is a fantastic appliance to provide ice for my office.\n",
      "I love this MF'in thing.  It's been working for 3 years and hasn't skipped a beat.  I clean it with vinegar and lemon juice and its good to go again.\n",
      "Doesn't fit my chairs which are 17.5 x 21. There is not enough vinyl to wrap the front edges of the chairs as shown in pictures. So not happy with the product and for some reason it is not returnable...\n",
      "Nice covers...covers chairs and super thick. Love them....great quality.....\n",
      "Thanks !!!\n",
      "Excellent!!!\n",
      "We ended up getting 8 of these, building two columns between ... well, between columns in the house. They are decent quality, easy to mount, look nice.  If I had one suggest it would be to make a right and left handed version so you could mount the bottle ends pointing either way.\n",
      "Very sturdy. Small footprint, so I was able to fit it on a small wall area, and maximize wine storage attractively.\n",
      "I had been looking for a secure wine bottle holder but also one that would not take away from my wine display corner.  These were the perfect racks.  I used 2 of them and had more space so I cut a third one down and had my husband sand the rough end), to where it would hold just 4 bottles so it would fit in the space.  Worked perfectly!  They are lightweight enough, yet strong enough.  Just be careful when placing them that you do not have them butted up against a wall on the left because you will need to pull the bottle out in that direction to remove it or replace it.  I am attaching pictures of my wine display.\n",
      "Perfect, put it on the side of my cabinet and have no worries.  I'm not sure that I would used the drywall anchors with this fully loaded, I recommend screwing straight into wood.\n",
      "I love the clean design of this. It hangs quickly. The rack doesn't hold bottles with a larger base, like champagne.\n",
      "It's not often that one finds a product that's both visually attractive AND functionally satisfying.  This kettle is one of those rare items: the shiny stainless steel body is beautiful to look at, and it boils water very very quickly!  It features a nice big and sturdy handle which is very comfortable, and the spout is perfectly designed so that you'd have to be a real klutz to spill things.  The cordless feature is wonderful, I tried a cheap ten dollar \"Hot Pot\" for a day or two and hated having to deal with the cord, plus that model doesn't have automatic shutoff despite what it says on the box---huge fire hazard!  There is also a power-indicator light and water-level indicator gauge which are both handy, and I like that there is no exposed heating element inside which would be a pain to clean.  Instead it's all smooth clean lines, inside and out!\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure the outside of the kettle does get a little hot so you probably don't want to have this within reach of toddlers or anything, but if your toddlers can get up on your kitchen countertop then you have a LOT of other problems as well!  I appreciated not having to deal with how plastic inevitably gets dirty-looking and sometimes leaves a funny taste in the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "My only slight concern is that the lid needs a little bit of force to shut completely...probably some kind of insulating seal that shortens the time needed to bring water to a boil, but makes me wonder how durable that part of this kettle is going to be.  Oh well, will find out in a few months or (hopefully) years, I suppose!\n",
      "\n",
      "*UPDATED 2/14/2011: Still going strong, no complaints at all.  I use it at least twice a day, most days.  The lid has held up well.  Highly recommend!\n",

      "I purchased ice bags and a metal\n",
      "Scoop (the tony plasic on was not impresive), can get a little more than two 10lb bags a day if I stay on too of it. The internal ice bin fills up about every hour. Which if not dumped the machine goes to stand buy and stops making ice and the ice in the bin will start to melt back into the water chamber and wait to make more ice.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have run vinegar thru it twice and it does take at least a full day of running to get the taste out of the ice.\n",
      "It has started to sound louder to me, this may be because it sits beside my sink and stove and I'm constantly listening to it OR the dust needs to be cleaned out of the back vents.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ice is 'wet' and does freeze together if bagged and put into a deep freeze. (Which is what we do)\n",
      "\n",
      "Over all very pleased...but to be honest because of the extra noise in my kitchen...next time I'll buy a used fridge and freezer with an ice maker built in and harvest ice from it, giving me extra fridge space+ice+freezer space ;)\n",
      "Works exactly as described.  Produces ice quickly and the smaller cubes even will fit in a water bottle if you want.\n",
      "I had one for 8 years just like this it just died ..this one is even faster then my old one ...\n",
      "Great Product!!!\n",
      "Just got these.  My intention is to keep the cats off of the the kitchen chairs.  Since putting them on the chair seats, the cats have not gotten up on them again, I don't think they like the plastic.  They are light enough that I can quickly remove them when we have guests.  So far, so good.\n",
      "Love it!\n",
      "I was concerned about strength and durability of these before I ordered but they seem to be really well made and not easily bent.\n",
      "We bought this ice maker on Amazon a year ago. We use it every weekend to produce 5 or 6 gallon bags of ice. It makes ice fast and hasn't had a single mechanical failure. It's pretty much the best ice maker I've ever used.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ice does come out really wet, so if you stick it straight into your ice bin it will freeze into a clump. We package it in gallon ziplock bags instead. After a night of freezing we just drop the bags onto the floor to break the ice up before putting it itk our ice bin.  It's the same as you'd do with store bought ice. Works beautifully.\n",
      "Having had this for six months, it has died.  When it worked, it worked \"OK\" making ice that was soft and melted quickly.  However, it was very useful.  Sadly, it died within six months.  I called the company and got a \"so sad\" response.\n",
      "I purchased this item after our icemaker in our freezer stopped working. Upon first use, it seems OK, but I'm reviewing it after using it for a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "This machine makes quick freeze ice.  You have some thin ice cubes in 12-15 minutes, but that also means it melts a lot quicker in your beverage or cooler.\n",
      "\n",
      "This unit is not made well enough for everyday use. The LCD panel is awful. You push one button and it either sticks and won't change settings, or it completely freezes up.  If it freezes up, you have to unplug the unit for a few seconds and let it reset.  The panel over the LCD is a cheap plastic sticker that does not stay in place. It finally fell off completely after 6 months, and I had to put a peice of clear packing tape over it keep it on.\n",
      "\n",
      "You MUST unplug the unit on a weekly basis and clean out the water reservoir with a dilute solution of bleach and water.  If you don't, you will see gross mold growing where your clean fresh water should be. As heavy as this thing is, it's difficult to lug it over to the sink as you akwardly try to clean it and rinse it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inside is made of an acrylic like plastic.  The ball and socket type hinges are also plastic.  The problem is, eventually a piece of ice comes out and gets jammed under the arm near the hinge, and it snaps the arm and hinge socket.  When this happens, your ice machine completely stops working. You cannot glue or epoxy it back together, it won't work.\n",
      "\n",
      "This happened after only 6 months of use.  Sunpentown's solution for this issue was to either have me pay to ship this heavy thing back so they can put yet another plastic piece in to replace the original, or send me the part if I felt confident in replacing it.  Luckily my husband had that skill and was able to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "BUT-6 months later, the same plastic pieces snapped again, and Sunpentown refused to send me another part unless I paid for it, because the 1 year warranty had just expired. I decided enough was enough and it went in the trash.\n",

      "The ice maker is very much like the one I had to replace. My old one was from china and could not get it repaired. The new one has already started having trouble.  The controls on the front keep coming loose from the cabinet.  This is a pain.  But I quess replacement parts again are not available. \"CHINA\"  Word be taken.\n",
      "for 2 years we suffered the problems of owning a Manitowac SM50 machine.  The repair man was out at least a dozen times, and finally, the machine 'died' and we refused to replace it with another one.  (Warranty was up, of course) EXPENSIVE LESSON LEARNED\n",

      "After searching for a machine that would meet our needs, I reluctantly ordered this little Ice Maker.  WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE!  We've had it for one month and it's been working like a CHARM!\n",

      "  Makes ice QUICKLY\n",
      "  Recycles the water when the ice melts\n",

      "\n",
      "After reading other reviews, we decided to do a very thorough cleaning of the machine prior to using..... using the vinegar/water manufacturer's recommendation, we ran the cleaning cycle 3 times (only took 5-10 minutes each time).  Then ran clear water through the same number of times.  We had no after-taste of the ice.\n",

      "Very difficult to \"adjust\" to our chairs. Finally got them to fit.\n",
      "We just love love love our wine racks. We ended up buying 4. Learn from our learning that they need a proper spacing in between them for the bottles to come out or placed in without touching each other just in case you plan to place them next to each other like the picture.\n",
      "We love this rack.  It holds up well and looks good in the kitchen.  No complaints.\n",
      "Love it!!! Super cute, really sturdy and holds the bottles well.\n",
      "I really like this wine rack.  It holds various size bottles without an issue.  The only reason I took a star off is I think that the ancors provided are week for the amount of wight that it is holding.  To fix this for me I put the screws right into a stud.\n",

      "Nice product and well made. Would buy again!\n",
      "Worked very well in transporting and serving devilled eggs.  I've seen other carriers that may have a more secure carrying capabilities, but if you are careful, this product worked well, and I did not have to transfer to a serving platter.\n",
      "perfect for displaying your eggs.\n",
      "NO  PROBLEMS\n",
      "It says it holds 24 deviled eggs securely. It may hold 24, but there are only 15 individual wells for the eggs. The rest would need to be placed in the one big area below where the label is. I am returning it because it was misrepresented.\n",
      "Cannot tie plastic straps to hold seat cover in place in the back. Very disappointed in this product. Does not fit well.\n",
      "Exactly as described. Perfect for my chairs. Quick delivery\n",
      "I love love love these!! They fit any size chair and are super easy to put on. We have padded chairs and they work great on coverage. Great product!\n",
      "Terrible. The material is okay, but they are far from being a customizable fit. It hangs, is uneven and there is no real way to secure them. The material is too sticky to tie and not sticky enough to adhere to itself. You can tie the \"strings\" in the back but it looks terrible both from the back and through the front. The flaps in front don't stick to each other and the opening is right above the two corners where you're most likely to spill something leaving your chair vulnerable. It just looks terrible and is highly non functional. There's no way these can stay in place with an adult getting up and down a few times never mind any squirmy children.\n",
      "I use this ice maker for a different purpose than most people. I brew beer at home and use a lot of ice at the end of the process to cool the beer for fermenting. This process uses four 7-lb bags of ice from the store that cost around $15.\n",
      "I followed all the directions and started the machine early on my brew day. It started right up and the first \"cubes\" popped out in about 15 minutes. I was thrilled. But at the end of the brew day, I had about enough ice to replace one 7-pound bag of ice. Not great, but maybe if I started the night before, it could do better.\n",
      "So I tried that. Unfortunately, unless you want to get up in the middle of the night just to check on the ice maker, it stops when the bin is full. So, I didn't really get much more ice that way, either.\n",
      "Guess I'll have to start a couple of days early and bag the ice and keep it in my freezer next time.\n",
      "\n",
      "One complaint: The digital display is pretty touchy. There is a crummy plastic cover over the controls that peeled back away from the control board before I even started. Normally, that would have been a reason to return it, but it's pretty minimal - and the machine still worked, so I gave it a pass. Still, it's pretty chintzy. And, although it's supposed to be able to make three different size \"cubes\" (they are actually hollow bullets of ice), it will only make the small and middle sizes. The controls won't even work to make the large size. Again, since I'm not making ice for normal uses, it doesn't bother me, but it's still pretty lame.\n",
      "I purchased this based on all the great reviews.  There are several reasons why I won't give this 5 stars and I was wavering between 3 and 4 stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not as easy as plug it in, add water and you have ice in 20 minutes.  The instructions say to clean it thoroughly by running it through it's cleaning cycle with 1:1 ratio of water and white vinegar or lemon juice, then drain it.  Add clean water and do the same again.  Next, run it through it's first cycle and discard the first batch of ice. The ice had a horrible chemical odor and taste!!  There were additional instructions if this should happen. Again, I added one cup of lemon juice (vinegar is hard to get rid of the odor)to an entire tank of water and run it through several cycles of ice. I had to throw away 4 or 5 baskets of ice.  I then rinsed it with clear water in the cleaning cycle.  Finally, the ice didn't have any odor!\n",

      "Pros:  *Quick at making ice.\n",
      "  *Three size selections of cubes.\n",
      "  *Makes large quantities.\n",

      "Now it doesn't work at all.  I called the manufacturer and they emailed me steps on how to check the motor to the water tray/scooper.  Upon inspection, the gear mechanism from the motor that controls the water tray was completely rusted, therefore unable to engage and turn.  I was told that any parts that were sent to me were no charge but of course I would have to repair it myself.  If the unit needs to be returned, I would have to pay for shipping.  This is a heavy piece of equipment and will cost a lot to ship back. What a disappointment for having this expensive ice maker for only six months.\n",

      "I've replaced the motor, (my husband was impressed at my technical skills... lol), and reshaped the output splash bar with needle nose pliers, and finally all is working well. The bent splash bar was the cause of the motor rusting because the water was spraying onto the motor gears. It's unfortunate that I was responsible for repairing the machine and I feel the manufacturer didn't stand by their product. They saw that it was defective, based on my photos, and in my opinion they should have replaced it at no charge to me. In the least, Sunpentown should have paid for me to ship it back and have it fixed by them. When I asked the representative, what my next step would be if the motor rusted out again, she simply said that it's still under the ORIGINAL warranty and they'd replace it, if need be, up until that point. In my opinion the motor warranty should have been extended for another year.  Unfortunately I got a lemon.\n",

The fabric got so destroyed at one point we had to reupholster the chairs so these are a MUST in our family. We have had to replace these plastic covers a few times because of wear & tear but again, they do the job so I'm not complaining. They do take a little time to eventually \"mold\" to the chair & those who wear shorts or have legs exposed with stick to the plastic (which the kids don't like) but again, these are a MUST for stubbornly messy kids if u wanna save ur furniture ha! The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because I wish the \"wear & tear\" time didn't sneak up on u so fast, they should probably improve the way they are tied to the chairs because that's where ours start to rip. But again, still worth buying! ;)\n",

      "comes with only two basic screws.  I need to use anchors for drywall.  Even still, 6 bottles (about 20 pounds) should have more mounting hardware.  This only has one on top, one on the bottom.  Should have two up top with more substantial screws.\n",

Very sturdy and slants a bit toward the corks so will keep them moist.  Much better than my pantry floor.  Nice enough looking so it could be mounted on a wall, too.\n",

The cover fits tightly but does not squash the eggs. The eggs don't move inside the carrier once the lid is on. The plastic is fairly sturdy and somewhat flexible. With care they should last a long time. I've used mine weekly all summer and they are still good as new.\n",

      "Previous version of this model was 5stars.  I've used it for 6 years, so no it's no surprise I went right back this item, ignored the warnings from other reviewers about the shortcomings of the newer version, and bought one.  I sent it back two days later, because the temperature sensor failed to stop boiling water.  Also, as others have noted, the base is now too light and flimsy, and although it wasn't a big issue for me, it's disappointing.\n",
      "This WAS great. Had one before for three years and it quit. That's OK. Liked it so much (bought my daughter one some time ago), that we ordered a replacement. This new one is identical woks great except that 50% of the time it does not shut off automatically; never had a problem with the others. Got to watch it, as it boils away!\n",
      "A fair option if you want to protect your chairs cushions from spills and stains. I agree with other reviewers though that you're better served buying a roll of heavy duty vinyl and doing all yourself. 1) the thickness of this vinyl doesn't match up to what I got in the past and 2) you really need to put in the same amount of work either way. To do this right you should unscrew your chair cushion, cover it with the vinyl, re-attach it, and enjoy. The size of this thinner vinyl chair protector may not be up to the every day tasks you require of it. It isn't my first choice but for a casual user looking to protect their chairs, it might do the job well enough.\n",

      "Kept slipping off and coming untied.\n",
      "They have a strong odor, and they don't fit properly. These covers rely on the plastic sticking to itself for fitting, and they are not sticking. Don't even bother.\n",
      "I liked this cover because I could see my chair and didn't have to cover entire chair with some fabric that wouldn't match my dining set.  Front leg covers okay... Not too secure.  The back ties are worthless.  If I didn't have a booster seat on top of this seat cover I doubt it would stay put.\n",
      "Love it.  Easy to hang.  Screws that accompanied were silver,  but I keep a bottle of dollar store black nail polish for such 'touch ups'.  Hung at the end of our kitchen cabinets.\n",

      "I took off the cushions and put this Clear Vinyl Chair Protectors cover on with using clear packing tape to secure it underneath nice and snug. (the heavy duty stuff, not scotch tape)\n",
      "Then I re-assembled my chairs. They had a pretty good look, however I only wanted to protect the original fabric from stains and was not crazy about the plastic look on the seat. I then bought slip covers called EZ Covers to put over the plastic. The easy covers are a bit small, so I sowed on 2 ties on each of the 4 sides to secure it underneath the chairs. Now my set up is perfect, if anyone spills on them, I can take off the covers and put them in the washer. The plastic stops the spill from getting to the original material, which will keep my dinette set looking great!  I also put a Benson Mills 3463 Clear Plastic Tablecloth on the table which looks great! My table is round with beveled designs through the glass with etching, very beautiful and unique. Hope this helps if you want what I did, to protect your stuff and still look beautiful.\n",

      "I love this kettle.  I have been using a version of this Aroma kettle for at least 15 years.  It is always reliable, boils water quickly and safely,  and stands up to constant use (I drink tea ALL day long).  About once a month, I bring the interior back to shiny new with an overnight soak to which I add a bit of vinegar or lemon juice.  Absolutely no problems.  I replace it every three or four years when the top rim shows signs of wear.  I like the way the tab clicks back when the water is ready, as I can hear it from a nearby room--no need to hover. I have given this kettle as a gift several times.  If you don't mind waiting for your water to cool down for green or white teas, this kettle is the way to go.\n",
      "So far they are working well to protect our cloth chairs from our messy kids!  I would buy again!\n",
      "Didnt last 5 months total on all 4 covers (I only use it on my sons chair). The ties don't work properly and are not long enough. They tore and ripped. I bought these based on the other reviews. Very dissapointed. Each one ripped and tore after a month of use.\n",
      "Good fit. Covers seat and sides of cushions on my chairs. I have cats that sometimes sit on chairs and covers keep them clean and I can wipe\n",
      "them with wet cloth to clean.\n",

      "Just what I wanted, does the job of holding 6 bottles of wine.\n",

      "Came on time, and worked out great for my project, I put this under a kitchen bar table / island I made.\n",
      "We bought this a long time ago and it's moved with us 3 times. It's sturdy, easy to hang, and holds the wine with no fear of falling.  It's a great decoration and is useful. Highly recommend!\n",
      "I wanted a rack to keep just a few bottles of wine along the wall in my basement stairs.  This rack holds six bottles securely, and doesn't take unnecessary space.  I bought two, and hung them one above the other: six red and six white.  Good rack for the price.\n",
      "Love this!  It is easy on and off and really helped protect our fabric-covered dining room chairs at Christmas.\n",

      "simple and good\n",
      "It does what it says and protects the seat, but it is UGLY. It has thin little plastic strips meant to help tie it to the chair and the excess plastic just hangs of he seat. I will probably tape the edges up underneath the seat in an effort to improve the appearance. We are only using one at the moment (on my 3 year old's dining chair) but I bought enough for all of our chairs (for when we have a table full of birthday party kids).\n",

Hard to read water line guage and it doesn't shut off when you pick it up.  DH went to BBB and came home with a B&D kettle that has everything missing from this one and cheaper.  We love it, it turns off when you pick it up and the water gage is on the side and even has a soft blue backlight.  This piece of junk is going back.\n",

That kettle worked it's heart for 3 years until it started leaking at the on/off switch.  I ordered a new kettle different brand....I tried a glass model this time...and had issues with that kettle immediately and had to return it. So the same day I got that return started, I decided to go back to my faithful Aroma Kettle.  I ordered it for same day delivery.  I opened it, prepped it, and low and behold, it started leaking at the on/off switch!  I was devastated!  This kettle is going back and sadly, I won't be purchasing another Aroma kettle.\n",

So nice to no have to climb up, or run downstairs to fetch when the occasion arises that a bottle of wine would make better...some days that can be surviving a day at work, or a Mn winter commute! We are very happy with this choice.\n",
      "Holds bottles of wine! Looks nice on the end cap of my bar in the living room. Mounting was easy, with a solid wood backing. If you're mounting in drywall/sheetrock/plaster, you might want to make a trip to the hardware store for some beefier mounting options. Drywall plugs and screws are included, but I don't know if I would trust them to hold six bottles of wine.\n",
      "This is a pretty secure and stable rack.  At first I thought the wiring would make it a bit for flimsy, but sits nicely on my wall and is currently holding five different wine bottles with ease.  I chose this style because I liked the slight angle on the wall.\n",
      "Work great to protect chairs\n",
      "The product does what it says... Protects against stains and spills BUT the whole overlapping and material sticking to itself in order to look decent just doesn't work. I tried all different ways to get the material to fold over itself to fit snugly but it just wouldn't. I ended up taking off the chair cushions and actually stapling the vinyl chair protectors to them. Ever since I did that, they have worked just fine with no rips and cleaning up spills is easy. I will say that the vinyl is thick and sturdy.\n",

      "I loved this kettle, had it for 5 years and noticed that metal flakes were floating in the water. The inside metal lining is totally flaking off into the water. It works great but it is a health hazard to ingest the metal.\n",
      "Amazing simple to use....It's perfect. I've had it a couple of years now and still works as good as day 1\n",
      "I bought this to replace an earlier model that I had had for about 8 years.  The older one just died one day, but after 8 years, I had no complaints.  The new one, which looks almost identical, is a much poorer product.\n",
      "First, the water level indicator window is extremely difficult to read, making it almost impossible to know if you have overfilled the kettle.\n",
      "Second, the unit does not turn off automatically when you remove it from the base.  This is dangerous because if you use all the liquid and return the unit to the base, it is STILL ON.  Possible fire hazard.\n",
      "I would not buy this item again nor could I ever recommend it.  Buy a different product that is easier to read and safer to use.\n",
      "Bought it for my grandma in 2011. Still going strong today!\n",
      "These were okay, serves the purpose and durable.\n",
      "Didn't fit my chairs right even tho they were the correct dimensions! I was disappointed!!\n",
      "Put these on my outdoor chairs to keep them clean - they work great and you can hose them off.\n",
      "They ripped too easily.  I guess they are fine if you don't use your chairs and they just sit there.\n",
      "nice quality\n",
      "Don't waste your money; I ended up just throwing them away.  I was envisioning something different, I guess.\n",
      "Need another set!  I have them both on, but haven't figured out how the make them fit tight in front.  Seem ok without doing that last step.\n",
      "This thing does the job.  It took me 10 minutes to installed it on my wall.  I had to use my own wall anchors to make it more sturdy, but other than that, it's as advertised.\n",
      "This is solidly built and stays sturdy with 6 bottles in it. It also looks very nice on my wall. One thing to be aware of... they give you two screws but it doesn't come with the plastic anchors needed to secure this to the wall. Wasn't a big deal because I had some at home, but if you don't have any, you'll need to pick some up from the hardware store.\n",
      "I got this for my mother for xmas and she loved it.  Super easy to hang with two screws that came with it...just find a stud, drill the pilot holes, and she's ready to go up.  Looks very nice when it has 6 bottles in it....can barely tell that anything is holding them up.  Just a simple, conservative wall wine rack.\n",
      "In the 6th month it started leaking. We use it every day, sometimes 2 or 3 times a day. I always put fresh water in it and I frequently wash it out. This is the 3rd one we have owned. The last one lasted several years. This one is quite disappointing. I will not purchase this brand again.\n",
      "These do not fit the chair size they suggest. They were too small. The flaps in the front would not stick together to give a custom fit. Very flimsy ties. I returned them\n",
      "they worked for what they are, plastic.  only issue is if it's a warm day and someone is wearing shorts, you may literally be stuck in your seat.  But they do allow the look of the chair seat to come through, and that's the nice feature.\n",
      "great protection for chairs\n",
      "These really class up the kitchen. Now, instead of having our wine bottles everywhere, they're in one spot. A big step up for us. Shipping was quick and the product works great.\n",
      "Inexpensive and great for decorating small living area. Now I have my wine in reach when I have social settings...another happy customer.\n",
      "Sturdy build and easy to instal. I just found a stud and put a few screws in it. I usually only keep it half filled but it has held up just fine. No quality issues and no worries about it falling apart.\n",
      "This is a simple product, looks and functions exactly as you'd expect.  It doesn't feel like a poorly manufactured product.  It holds the wine bottles just right.  Highly recommended.\n",
      "Great product.  Mounted easily on the wall.  Holds several bottle effectively.  If you have a small space and don't want to spend a  lot of money, this is perfect!\n",
      "While the vinyl is heavier than the last ones I had, I do not like them.  The flaps were supposed to stick to each other to hold them in place, however fastening these to my chairs required scotch tape to hold them in place. Sorry I bought these.\n",
      "bought to put under a chair cover for my daughter's chair/booster seat in case she spills milk onto our new chairs.  It didn't need to fit well because I threw a chair cover over it so no one would see.  I wouldn't get these and expect to use them on my chairs without covering them up\n",
      "I keep these on my dining chairs between family gatherings. I have several cats that seem to think the chairs are their personal beds and now the chairs are cat hair free for all my gatherings! They are easy to put on and off.\n",
      "I bought it for 6 months, but I only used it in the last two months. It broke yesterday. I would never buy this brand again.\n",

      "There were many Aroma kettles to choose from here on Amazon. I selected this one mainly based on price. I wish I had bought a more expensive model though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good stuff: Well constructed, stainless steel housing, has water fill level view port, heats water quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stuff I wish it had: A retractable power cord; a lighted power switch so you can easily tell if the thing is still heating or not.; a wider and more easily viewable water level viewing port (it is narrow and next to the handle - hard to see if water is inside or not. I have to pick up the kettle to see if it's got anything in it).\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of the more expensive Aroma kettles have the features I am missing on this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I would recommend this kettle: for the money, it is a well made kettle that heats water quickly. I just wish I had spent a little more and got one with more features.\n",
      "I love this thing.  We always used a whistling stove-top kettle, but honestly I got tired of washing it constantly, because I cook a lot, and it was getting splattered with food and sauces every day.  My cat knocked the old one over one day, and the handle broke off, so that was the excuse I needed to search for an alternative.  I thought about getting another stove-top one, but then came across this beauty.  I use a Clever Dripper for my daily cup o' coffee, so a kettle is a must.  I wasn't sure this would be as simple or fast to use as a stove-top one, but I'm really pleased.  This kettle heats up FAST.  It's so easy to use, I think my dog could probably turn it on for me.  I've seen some older reviews voicing some concerns over the filter in the spout.  Don't worry!  That's been changed now, and I've had absolutely no problems with mine whatsoever.  This kettle is a good size, lifts off very nice and easily from the base, and pours neatly.  Since I purchased it, I've used it multiple times every day.  I use it for oatmeal, hot cocoa, coffee (of course), tea, etc. and it really has improved life in the kitchen.\n",
      "For the price this is a cool little rack. It functions and looks exactly like I thought it would. I'm very happy.\n",
      "We purchased this rack to go along with our new bar, and all black/green formal dining room.  It comes with hardware to attach it to the wall, and arrived in perfect condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Preparation is extremely simple-open box, find where you want to put the rack, screw into wall.  Yep, its that easy.  We always get compliments on our bar, and this is the new perfect addition to our dining room.  Simple, yet elegant enough to show off.  Couldn't have done better!\n",
      "\n",
      "-Hannah\n",
      "This was a gift and they loved it. It holds 6 bottles which is great for the price that I got it for!\n",
      "It took a couple weeks to arrive. But came with all the hardware.  A simple process of screwing into the wall.  It appears very sturdy and looks sensational on my wall.  I am glad I purchased it!\n",
      "Love these.  They have saved my white chairs now that we have kids!!\n",
      "I bought this off Amazon back in 2010, this is still going strong. I use it for instant coffee, instant oatmeal, ramen, etc... I am surprised it would last so long!\n",
      "Great buy. Very efficient device.\n",
      "Sent back.  Makes a lot of noise.\n",
      "Great design tips bottles down to keep cork moist and prevent outgassing. I have mine mounted on the cellar stairs wall within easy reach of the upstairs door. Great way to store a few of your favorites in the cool, dark as they should be.\n",
      "Functional and compact, a great holder of your favorite wine. Not the most intricate or beautiful out there, but it does the job. Had to bend mine a little to align the loops for the bottle necks, but this one fit in my already full kitchen and out of the way. For practical use, I give it an A- due to the fact that it had to be bent into shape a bit.\n",
      "This wine rack is perfect to decorate a wall with a small wine display.\n",
      "These are great for under our kids' booster seats - easy to wipe clean\n",
      "easy to  put on and works\n",
      "The chair covers are the right size and good quality, but they are very difficult to put on. In fact, I have not been able to get them on my chairs yet.  The instructions included are not sufficient for my understanding.\n",
      "I PUT THESE ON MY BRAND NEW DINING ROOM CHAIRS.  I KNOW- IT'S TACKY!  BUT IT BEATS HAVING TO REMOVE THE ORIGINAL CHAIR PAD OR \"SPOT CLEAN\"  THE CHAIR PAD STAIN THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO EVER FADE AWAY!  I JUST PUT A VERY CHEAP CHAIR PAD THAT MATCHES OVER THE SEAT OF THE CHAIR SO THE SITTER DOESN'T SWEAT  ON VINYL.!\n",
      "Thanks\n",
      "LOVE THE FIT HOPE IT WEARS WELL IN THE FUTURE.\n",
      "The covers do not stay in place\n",
      "really weird shape, doesn't fit the chair as shown\n",
      "Good quality, for it ok doesn't wrap around.\n",
      "Very convenient teapot! And inexpensive too.\n",
      "We already have it for a few months, and it works fine and very easy to use.\n",
      "Much better than the one we had before - forgot the brand.\n",
      "This item came defective. The lid sealed shut and I couldn't get it open. I had to send it back.\n",
      "This isn't exactly ideal but so far it seems to be keeping the dirt and waste from the children off. It will get by.\n",
      "The clear vinyl chair seat protectors were just what I needed.  My chair seats were covered and protected and the beauty of my dining set could be seen. The back of my chairs are covered with fabric and I wish you had clear vinyl protectors for the back of the chairs.  It could be tied or slipped over the backs of the chairs.  Do you have a clear vinyl protectors that would be useful to me?  I wish to hear from you asap,\n",
      "Nice for protection, but could be better made, to hold the front down. Large enough to cover my large seated chairs.\n",
      "Although they are a little small for my chairs, I put them on and use them anyway.\n",
      "Directions were not too compatible with this 84 year old woman.  Could not figure out what to do with the front but it is helping and I just keep a cover over it.  Don't post this comment.\n",
      "Great deal and great product and fast ship!  Thank you!\n",
      "If you buy Bed Sheet Holders (Large ones) and run two on each chair underneath they work fine. the cheap plastic ties break too easy and don't hold them down well. This is for adults, now if you think it will work for kids without the bed sheet holders, forget about it period. My chairs are trashed and will be replacing the tops with a much better fabric they can't kill so easily.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just haven't found anything else for this purpose and this is pricey for the inherent failures before you put more into it.\n",
      "wonderful\n",
      "I received mine broken. The on buttom would shut it off by itself before the water would boil. O returned it.\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "this hot water pot is just great plus you know how much water is in it\n",
      "Still running well after many months of daily usage.\n",
      "Love it\n",
      "These do what they're supposed to.  Thick plastic.  Easy to install.  They seem designed to be tacky, which helps with fitting.  Ties seem a bit flimsy and are difficult to knot because they're so tacky.\n",
      "Not as big and thinner than I expected.\n",
      "really cheaply made, Not worth the money...\n",
      "good protection.\n",
      "I use them to cover my outside chair seats. They work great.\n",
      "Thick vinyl, has not kept the cats from laying on the chairs but their fur is now not sticking to the seats. I recommend these!\n",
      "just what I needed to keep the cats off\n",
      "I bought it a year ago and the lid broke off. I used it almost every day in the morning.\n",
      "Cant beat this water heater for the price,  We been buying them for years.  Best for smaller amounts of water to boil.\n",
      "These covers work really well - easy to put on (make sure you take your time and use the paper prompts to help you pull the ends apart).  They are fairly durable, but can rip if you pull them too hard.  I originally ordered them for my kids' desk chairs, and then again for my mother's dining room chairs.  When I made the second order, I ordered another pack for myself as \"back-up\".  Already, we have a torn one.  But the price is perfect for replacing as they are not expensive.  Recommended!!\n",
      "As stated.\n",
      "Worked perfectly!\n",
      "The plastic is very durable but somewhat difficult to secure on the chairs.\n",
      "First time I can honestly say I'm disappointed.  This item arrived early so I was excited.  I pulled the lower section out and unwrapped it all in preparation to assemble.  Their was damage to the unit, pieces missing, holes not drilled through and clear, sections pulled loose from others.  Even if it was all in tact, it wasn't quite the level of quality I had hoped for.  I stacked everything again, set it aside and now have to decide if I want to box it all up and ship it back or by wood glue, a drill and other items to repair, reassemble and salvage my purchase.\n",
      "I chose this rating because after my husband put this hutch together it is absolutely  beautiful. It is room and very elegant. Adds class to out nook area. It is a lot to put together, but the end product makes it worth it. it took about 6 hours to put together. Great buy!!\n",
      "Like everyone has said, assembly was a pain.  But, if you have a handy guy and the right tools, it's not so bad.  We had one drawer that just didn't have holes on one side, so we had to drill them in.  Then we got the whole thing together and the right side top shelf wouldn't go down.  The peg in one of the boards was off center.  So we had to saw it off and use wood glue to hold it in the right position.  Probably took us about 4 hours to put the entire thing together.  But it looks fabulous.  I would buy it again.\n",
      "We bought this buffet cabinet two years ago from Amazon and really like it.  It looks fantastic in our dining area and is great for storing our wine glasses in the glass door portion.  Makes for great storage for some of our serving pieces in the doors at the bottom.  My main complaint is that the drawers are very small and not useful for much.  Also, be aware that you will likely have to attach the unit to the wall to keep it from tipping over (especially if you have young children, like we do).  It does come with the attachments.  Overall, the quality is good and it looks great and we are glad we bought it.\n",
      "Great affordable product. Great for making tea!\n",
      "works very well\n",
      "I have had it less than a month and already it is starting to be temperamental when I push the button.\n",
      "Bought it for my wife and she LOVES it!\n",
      "I was having the entire clan to my house for New Years.  I knew my neighbors were bringing red wine and had visions of my lovely cream colored chairs being stained with wine and food.  These little beauties saved my chairs.  Yes, I took a little ribbing for having plastic seat covers but my dining room chairs looked like brand new after the festivities.\n",
      "I love the ease that they go on the chairs and they stay in place. Even with my active cats jumping up and down, the covers don't move. They were shipped quickly and packed well for shipping. I am very happy with my purchase.\n",
      "I got this to protect the upholstered dining room chair my 3 year old sits in, but I quickly discovered it was very uncomfortable for him when wearing shorts, and the vinyl kept getting all bunched to one side, and it just looked horrible.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I went and got a soft seat cushion pad that ties on to the chair (meant for solid wood chairs), and that is working much better.  It will get dirty and stained but unlike the upholstery it can be replaced, and it's so much more comfortable for him and better looking.\n",
      "Purchased this in 2010, it is still working perfectly! Have been using this for my morning coffee every day for over 6 years in my loft.  Decided to buy a second for the kitchen, I hate waiting for the kettle to boil and also as a back-up, can't believe any small appliance could last this long.  If the quality is the same, I will buy a couple more as Christmas gifts for my children.  Amazing little kettle, it works and looks as good as the day I bought it.\n",
      "So awesome, I bought them for friends and family, we're all still using them years later. Great value!\n",
      "I bought this kettle six years ago. I use it to make hot chocolate, tea, oatmeal, noodles, and water for my hot water bag. It's awesome, high quality, works flawlessly. It has not rusted or fallen apart. I use tap water. It does scale, but I boil it once a month with a half a squeezed lemon and it cleans up really well and easily. Everything about this product works as well as the day I bought it. The auto shut off works fine. The water does not taste of metal or plastic. The outside still looks beautiful and new (I never submerge it in water to clean it, I just wipe with a damp kitchen towel). I empty the water out right after using it. In the past six years, I've forgotten to do this a few times, and the bottom never rusted out or became icky or anything. My parents liked it so much I got them the same one. My brother liked it so much he took it with him when he moved out. That's why I'm back to buy another one. Seems like a lot of new kettles are on the market these days. I'm going with the same one I bought before. I hope that Aroma hasn't changed anything over the years. Five stars, no regrets. My only problem - the little mesh filter by the spout -- I lost it. I took it out to clean and dry, but never saw it again one day. They don't sell replacements, sadly (they should, this product certainly lasts through the years). Oh well. Moving on. Love it, you'll want to keep this kettle in your life forever once you have it.\n",
      "3 years later, still working like day one. Easy to maintain. I use this almost everyday, this thing is a work horse!\n",
      "Not my favorite product. It is hard to fill with refridgerator filtered water due to small spout opening. Unit rusts quickly and needs the insides scoured with steel wool or SOS pads to remove calcium deposits, which is hard because the flip lid has a hole that is too small for adult hands.\n",
      "I purchased these for a friend and she loves them.  It helps keep her chairs clean when her husband split things.\n",
      "The Clear Vinyl Chair Protectors didn't work well for me.  They were not flexible enough or sturdy enough to be useful.\n",
      "These covers are a more pliable material than old ones, with a more secure fit and adjusting. They're more comfortable to use with a less cheap and tacking look.\n",
      "This plastic is very heavy and unyeilding.  also very slippery. As soon as you sit down, you are sliding all over, the ties are made of the same plastic and totally useless\n",
      "Looks great in my kitchen, using it as a coffee station, although I was expecting a little better quality.  The drawers are very shallow and do not pull out too far and are difficult to operate as they do not slide easily.  Lots of fiberboard and somewhat overpriced for the quality.  Shipping was a nightmare as they kept saying they could not deliver it because no one was home, but that was an issue with my local delivery office. I contacted amazon and they took care of things and even gave me a concession for my inconvenience.\n",
      "When I first started shopping for 'china cabinets', I wanted something practical - attractive, but useful.  After scrolling through quite a few sites and pictures and descriptions, I came across this cabinet and I was happy.  I read the reviews and I looked at the specs and decided to purchase it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I actually put this together myself (which I do not recommend - you need someone to help).  I got really frustrated but that was only because I was doing this alone and it was difficult (not impossible, but again, I suggest getting assistance).  I think they actually offer assembly service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once it was put together, that only validated my decision to purchase this.  I was able to put some of my mom's (she passed away this year) tea sets that she collected on display as well as use it for things that I plan on using as well.  I use the drawers for candles and baking accessories.  It has a wine cubby that holds 9 bottles of wine which I have full of red, whites and chardonnay. It also has a cubby above it for whatever (I use it for mixing bowls).\n",
      "\n",
      "This is very good for my dining room.  It is a little tight squeeze (as I have a large dining room table set in the same area), but again, very pleased with the space.  I may rearrange in the future but I am happy the way it is now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just a note:  It says to keep it out of the sun (which is interesting).  Also, note that this comes in a smaller size (basically that means instead of 3 drawers, it has two).\n",
      "\n",
      "I put pictures below.\n",
      "This is a decent piece of furniture. It is indeed wood (mostly) and has pretty good functionality. I was able to put it together after several hours, with a little help. Instructions were easy to follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is notable is that there were two of the same parts that were damaged - the blocks or planks of wood that have the roller gear for the drawers were ripped off. It seems it's common for those pieces to be damaged or loose during shipping. Although, there is a way to screw them back on if the damage is minimal (I recommend you purchase wood glue to help reinforce those blocks if they are detached on arrival).\n",
      "\n",
      "Things I Like:\n",
      "\n",
      "Once it was put together it looked great. It is an actual piece of furniture, not like the usual assembled pieces you get for pretty cheap. I believe this will hold up very well to moving or transfer. I was able to fit my microwave (a Panasonic 1.2 cu. ft - for reference) on top, as you can see in the pic. The microwave does extend about 3/4\" from the edge, but the feet of the microwave are nearly 2\" from the edge, giving it plenty of room to stand firmly. The bottom cabinets have quite a bit of storage. The wine cubby is sturdy. I believe it's worth $400 given it is made mostly of wood. I wouldn't pay more than that if I found this at a furniture store, especially if I had to put it together. But, worth it nonetheless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Things I Don't Like:\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing I can complain about are the drawers. They are functional and have at least a little room for storage, but one doesn't open smoothly, it has to be yanked slightly. It may something to do with the damaged wood plank that has the roller gear. The plank itself wasn't damaged during shipping, only detached from the base of the piece. I screwed it back in to the correct position, however the wheel seems to be catching on something when I pull out the drawer, indicating a possible misalignment. Anyway, I believe I can fix it but I haven't tried yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, and this may be a minor issue for most, are the glass pieces in the doors on the hutch. The glass is not firmly fixed causing it to rattle every time you open or close the doors, the drawers, or bottom cabinets. But, that also can be fixed relatively easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall:\n",
      "\n",
      "I would recommend this piece to others - even with the need for few tweaks such as wood glue etc,. Other than that, it's solid and looks nice.\n",
      "highly recommend. came on time, well packaged, solid wood as desribed. well designed, went together perfectly. such a good deal for the price. beautiful.\n",
      "the piece arrived on time  was happy.  Started to assemble the hutch and pieces were missing  eventually I got the missing parts will get back to assemble of this buffet hope there are no more missing items\n",
      "This is really wood not press-board I was impressed with that. The only thing that I had a problem with was the counter top is a bit to narrow for my microwave oven but it just fits. This was easy to put together. It is much easier for two people to assemble as some holding and simultaneous screwing down was needed. Overall it is a great product. It was exactly as pictured. The hutch is secured to the back with two screw plates. I wish that there were pegs or something to better secure it but I think that it will be ok. I secured the top to the wall as I have toddlers rinning and climbing on everything.\n",
      "I purchased these for my one year old's first birthday party. They were perfect for preventing my upholstered chairs from getting stained but these are not for everyday use. The ties broke after their one use and had to be thrown away. I do think they are a little pricey to be used once.\n",
      "Worked well to protect our dining chairs.  these are not beautiful but they are functional.  I have them under my grandchildrens' booster seats.\n",
      "I only gave this one star because I had to.  I wish Amazon would come up with a minus.  I bought these at Bed, Bath and Beyond, and they are going back first thing tomorrow.  They do not cling, and they are impossible to tie.\n",
      "My chairs are 16\" x 16\" x 21\" and these do not fit well at all. Can't imagine trying it on a 21\" x 21\" seat. The cover is suppose to overlap and stick to itself at the corner, but there is not enough cover to do that successfully. With the help of some clear packing tape I'm going to use them to train my cats not to scratch the upholstery and then they will go in the trash! Would not buy these again.\n",
      "Bought these to keep my cat off the white dining room chairs and they work like a charm.  He doesn't go on them at all.\n",
      "I purchased this kettle over the holidays in 2011. It's been sitting next to my desk at work heating my water week in and week out. I've never had a problem with it so of course I'm a very satisfied customer. The only thing that I can think of for those that have had their own issues might be that they have to move it around and that may be a contributing factor with their troubles. I haven't had to move it accept to fill it and dust around it.\n",
      "Love this kettle. I just realized that I have had my kettle for five years! I have never had a problem with it. It does everything it says it will without a glitch. I use it multiple times a day. I even used it to provide hot water for washing up during a 2 week outage of my propane water heater. I would recommend this little beauty to anyone wanting a superior kettle at a great price.\n",
      "still work as of today 8/4/2016\n",
      "This is a great piece and matches my dining set better than anything else. It is a little smaller than I had imagined but it is what it is. It holds my china and fills my space. So it fulfills my main requirements. The frames to the glass doors are a little thin but other than that it's pretty sturdy. My husband said it took a while to put together but he said it wasn't as bad as some of the reviews made it out to be.\n",
      "I brought these covers for my dinning room chairs because the seat cushions\n",
      "are white, and we all know what can happen to any items that are white .\n",
      "I simply love the way I can tie them to the chair, they fit snug as a rug.\n",
      "I wasn't expecting much out of vinyl chair protectors except that they covered the chair and stayed on under my kids' booster seats, and these do the job. The only downside is the ties on the back are very flimsy and made of plastic, and I don't think they'd stay on if there were adults sliding in and out of the chairs. But to put under kids' highchair seats and booster seats, these are perfect. They cover the chair completely.\n",
      "Too hard to fit right on the chair. It keeps coming loose so I finally just took them off. Oh well!\n",
      "Great quality\n",
      "My two boys (ages 2.5 and 1.5) are complete disasters during meal time.  Food goes everywhere and clean up has always been a nightmare.  Every week I found myself scrubbing the microfiber cushions of my dining chair (under my 2 year old's booster seat).  Suddenly a light went off and I realized that this was preventable!  Thanks to Prime I had these seat covers a few days later and I no longer run an upholstery cleaning business out of my kitchen.  Just last week my 1.5 year old moved to a booster from his high chair so I put the second cover from the set on right away.  I even ordered an extra set for when we have their little friends over.  Love these and they fit well.\n",
      "They tie on and don't really look all fitted like the photo. They do keep my cats from clawing the chairs in question.\n",
      "I bought these for under the booster seats to protect our chair seats from our kids. The work and fit fine, I, not sure about the ties in the back. They seem like they might break off, but they haven't so far. Also- the front just kinda laps over, but doesn't stick to itself.so it's a little looser then I would prefer. But again, they do protect and serve their purpose!\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE: while it's still working, the plastic is ripping at the corner. I'm debating trying to repair it r cut if off salvaging as much of it to keep the set covered as possible!\n",
      "Exactly what I was looking for and cover the entire chair, very important. I will purchasing another. Definitely would recommend this item.\n",
      "These were the perfect answer for my newly upholstered dining-room chairs. The cats can not pick at the material and I can still see the beautiful new chairs.\n",
      "Handle falls apart from the main body in less than 2 years. Boils water in decent speed while it lasted.\n",
      "We use it daily for tea- great!\n",
      "Ordered this on  February 15, 2011. it worked great until yesterday, the little 'handle' that you flip down to turn it on finally stopped working. It had been acting up a little for the last few weeks.  Just ordered another one. Rarely do you get to have something that will actually perform well and last a long time!  I used this every day at least once, most of the time 5-7 times a day.\n",
      "Been using this for more than 3 yrs now!\n",

      "********\n",
      "UPDATE:It is now 07/19/14 and they have just begun (with daily heavy usage) to wear out. They are still holding up, but one tie has pulled out(I fixed with clear tape)and two have gotten small tears (fixed same way), but golly, I believe that I have totally gotten my money's worth on these. I do highly recommend!\n",
      "The plastic is heavy enough, but they don't fit the chair well and need some tweaking. I had gotten these chairs from my mother, who had two plastic covers out of 6, and needed 4 more. Hers were much, much nicer, fit better and had a velcro tie to keep them together. These stick out all around and make the chairs look a bit cheap. They do not fit as nicely as in the picture.\n",
      "This is our 3rd of these kettles.  We use them daily and they seem to last quite a while, that is over 5 years for one of them.  We have tried other brands but keep coming back to these. I like the simple style, although they seem to change out the way the lid lifts.\n",
      "This is so handy to heat up water at my job where there is no stove around.\n",
      "I bought this almost 4 years ago and have used it several times a day (almost daily), and this thing is still as reliable as ever. It is basically self-cleaning if you use it all the time, so I never have to worry about cleaning it. I do have a second set in the basement that doesn't get used as often (also 4 years old and still going strong), and I'll give that one a quick rinse before I use it. This is the most heavily used appliance in my home and I would recommend this to anyone interested in a tea kettle. Here's what I love most about it:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) doesn't take up much space\n",
      "2) I can turn it on and forget about it\n",

      "4) looks attractive enough to leave out on the counter\n",
      "5) not too loud, no obnoxious squeal like a stove kettle\n",
      "6) lightweight and easy to carry\n",
      "7) holds more than enough water- it's enough to fill up a small hot water bottle to the max and still give you a large mug of tea\n",
      "I have been using my Microwave to heat my water to make a cup of coffee or tea.  As a result my microwave has rusted in the seems from the steam.  It is fifteen years old and I do not plan to replace it until it is broken.  New ones have the same features and work the same way.\n",
      "I notice that my coffee cups where looking different from the overheating.  So I bought this pot to heat all my hot water needs.  Save energy and money.  It takes less time and energy to heat 4 cups of water than the microwave. and stove.  Plus I am saving my coffee cups from the uneven heat destruction from the microwave.  We all know that because it says microwave safe does not mean that materials heat evenly.  I have thrown out cups that have burned me from the microwave.  If you are a instant coffee and tea  drinker or instant Jello maker, than this is a good investment and time saver.\n",
      "This has just started to fail, I have used this kettle so much and loved it! I hope they still make it, as I would reorder in a heartbeat!\n",
      "works great in my spice rack area and holds alot of spices...would highly recommend it.  Works very well. Great for the price.\n",
      "I expected this turn table to be used on the table, but it is cheap looking and comes apart when you pick it up. The rollers are a seperate piece. It also doesn't turn evenly, kind of wobbles. Not good. Spend more money and get a better one.\n",
      "We have two very furry non-declawed cats and leather dining chairs that they have claimed as their beds. The cats scratched the leather of our previous chairs, so we were covering the new ones with towels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I am not going to say that these do not look cheap and gaudy  - they do - but it is much better than the towels. And they fit our needs because (1) the plastic is thick enough and the claws leave no marks on it; (2) they stay in place when the cats jump on and off (we stapled the plastic flaps together at the corners to make sure that the covers covered the seats nice and snugly); and (3) they are slippery enough for the fur not to stick and accumulate (which would have happened if we got cloth covers). I got two at first to test them, and now - a month later - we decided that they passed the test and getting two more to complete the set.\n",
      "\n",
      "We barely ever use the chairs ourselves, so I cannot comment on how much the covers withstand heavy use by creatures that weigh over 15 lbs. The straps do look kind of flimsy...\n",
      "I bought these to protect our dining chairs from our cats.  So far, they have done the job.  I don't anticipate them to last a real long time, but for what I paid I'm happy with them.\n",
      "They're okay, had to do some adjusting to get them to fit. Had to use push pins to secure the corners.\n",

If top isn't securely snap- closed, the water will reach & continue at a rolling boil indefinitely, without recognizing that \" boil\" has been achieved- This is just unnecessary overuse /abuse of the heating element.

      "I've seen these growing up and I thought they were more for fun than really useful.  But then, i moved into a condo that had some in the kitchen cabinets and I discovered how wonderful they are.  No more trying to move everything to reach the stuff in the back of the cabinet and then knocking things over.  Or, you end up taking stuff out of cabinets to get to things in the back.  It seems too easy, but I put in two, and then more and then a really big one in the panty.  It is so great to just turn and the stuff in back is in easy reach.  I thought this was a fad from the 1960's. I stand corrected.  Everything is now easy to reach and nicely organized.  There is a place for everything.\n",
      "Get the other Madesmart (10\") or the OXO (11\").  This cheaper Madesmart turntable has a small diameter base making it more tippy and the edge can easily bump against other things. Both the OXO and the other MadeSmart have a full diameter base that is slightly larger in diameter than the rotating top and this way it keeps the rotating table from bumping other stuff.  And the other ones seem to be better made too.\n",
      "Quality product! Well made.\n",
      "This item is sturdy and reasonably attractive. It does indeed measure 10 inches in diameter. One of the supports on my existing double turntable broke. I decided to replace it and add this basic turntable for a different shelf. The original turntable has an odd lip that is narrow at the top but wider at the base, leaving less apparent room. That lip sometimes made items a little cramped, but it was still usable. I thought the space of this slightly smaller turn table might be comparable. It is not.\n",
      "\n",
      "The issue I had with the turntable is the lip around the outer edge. In the image you can see the lip and guesstimate the approximate width and height of the lip. Unfortunately, it is difficult to guesstimate how much actual, usable space you will have remaining when accepting for the lip. It is HUGE and I guesstimated incorrectly. Six of the taller jars (2-3/16\"w x 5-1/4\"h) that fit on my original turntable would not fit on this turntable. The lip rendered the remaining space on the turntable itself unusable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, this item is sturdy and reasonably attractive. I suppose it is useful if you have only a few items to place on it, but since this turntable will most likely not being spun like \"The Wheel of Fortune\", I am not sure why the design sacrificed space for a honkin' huge retaining wall of a lip. I returned this item and the matching double turntable. I replaced them with the single Rubbermaid turntable and double turntable.\n",
      "This is the second time I have ordered these (I cannot locate my \"extras\" put away in storage\" and I think they are terrific if you have young, messy eaters.

      "\n",
      "Would I buy these again? Probably, since I can't find anything better. My complaint with these is the slits in all four corners. They are there so that they can open up at the corners of your chairs. The problem is that each little slit will open and expose your chairs cushions (or whatever is underneath).\n",
      "You get what you pay for with this product.  Both covers tore a the corners and one tie broke off.  In all fairness they do get heavy use; I use them under my kids booster seats.  But still, you'd think they'd last longer than six months.\n",
      "I purchased this over 5 years ago, and I still use it more than 3 times a week.  It works just as well as the day I bought it.  Very fast boil times and no leaks.  If you are close to clicking purchase I say \"Go for it!\"\n",

      "We've had several of these.  This one is just a month old (a few days out of the return window) and it intermittently does not shut off, which is a safety hazard.  Today I let it run for 10 minutes after the water was boiling and it still did not turn off.  There was too much water in it to wait and see what it would do if it all boiled away.\n",
      "I've had this kettle for almost 2 years and use it every day, many times upwards of 3-4x a day. This kettle is absolutely fantastic and we have zero complaints. We love it so much we bought one for my parents, who also love it as much. It heats up water ridiculously fast and holds plenty of water. I saw one photo saying it rusted, but that isn't the case. Sometimes a scale (mineral deposits) can build up on the inside depending on the hardness of the water. This is easily solved by letting a bit of diluted vinegar soak inside the kettle for a few hours until it is gone.\n",
      "Brings water to a full boil very quickly\n",
      "Well-designed, ball-bearing turntable is smooth/responsive, and the rubber surface keeps spices from shifting/toppling even in brisk spins. It's not the most space-efficient for small cabinets. The surface of the turntable is about 2cm above the surface on which it stands, the rail costs another 1cm. I wish they offered an 11\" diameter, 2-tier version.  Nevertheless, I'm keeping it.\n",

      "The little teapot (.2L smaller than most) is all stainless steel with no extra parts inside.  The only part that is plastic that comes in contact with the water is the top off which some water may drip after boiling.  Full pot of cold water goes to boiling and pot shut off in 4 min and 28 secs.  I had one just like this for maybe 10 -12 years before I got this one.  I am so very happy with it and recommending it to any one who wants an all steel pot.\\\n",
      "*******Update, after one year of usage, the pot died.  The heating starts up...I can see by the light...but it shuts off within a few seconds and I can't get hot water any more.  I see the pot is on sale now...I wonder if $34 a year is worth it for hot water.  Do I have to buy a new pot every year?  I kept this one in sparkling clean condition and it useless now.\n",
      "OK, so I learned very quickly that either you make sure all those little holes are in the meat before you push the plunger on the gadget, or you wear the marinade! We put a garlic herb marinade in a pork roast, and that was the moistest, most flavorful pork roast we've ever had. Putting the flavor inside the meat works so much better than a rub on the outside. Next, we're going to experiment with the chopped herbs/minced garlic injector and see what we can come up with.\n",
      "The Bayau Classic 5011 Stainless Steel Injector performed better than expected.  I have used several of the plastic injectors and experienced leakage even to the point of cracking.  Not so with this producr.  It is a little pricy but I believe well worth the money.\n",
      "The injector works well, BUT... if you're going to use the minced herb injector, you will need to fill it thru the cap, and only the smaller pieces will go thru the small needle holes. I use it more as a baster with the ability to inject the marinade into the meat. The marinade needle will allow you to use the syringe as a suction to pull in liquid from the bottom of the pan and you can either dribble it over the meat, or actually inject it into the meat. It feels nice and sturdy.\n",
      "I used this product for my thanksgiving turkey and it worked great! I have also used it for meats and chicken... This is much better than any other injector that I have used out there\n",
      "These rusted after 1 use and I hand washed them. I should've returned these.\n",
      "This is a metal cup. There was a sharp piece of metal sticking out on the side. It would have been difficult to use the cup without cutting my hand.  This was especially concerning because of my daughter.  I returned it, very disappointed!!!\n",
      "I use these as a \"bowl\" for my immersion blender. It holds a pint or so of liquid and allows me to blend even at high speeds. My particular stick blender does not fit all the way down to the base, but this fact has not resulted in any problems [your stick blender may vary] with liquids or semi-solids like mashed potatoes. The blender seems to suck up what ever is on the bottom and blend it in with the rest of the project. Remember add Dry to Wet.\n",
      ">.. This is not a good insulator, so I would recommend that soups or other HOT projects be blended in the pan, or in a separate blender. There is no good outcome of dropping this container while trying to blend hot liquids.\n",
      "I bought to use w my Braun hand  mixer.  It was not the size it said. That was a total misrep..it was only 2.5\" across bottom.  So that's reason for low rating otherwise I would've given good rating.\n",
      "Nice solid cup\n",

      "We love it - heats quickly and is easy to use and does not take up a lot of room on the counter.\n",
      "Just a word of warning...this was my second pot because the first (5 stars) gave up. The new one was left alone in the kitchen as I talked on the connected back porch.  When I came in, it hadn't shut off, cooked dry, and ruined 3 of my wonderful oak good cabinet doors.  I know the pot was closed, it was new so not dirty inside, and seemed this time to be making a little different sound then the first when it shut off.  The water was all over the ceiling, cabinets, etc.  It is a good pot but don't leave it alone!!!  Just a terrible accident.\n",

      "I have not used it every day in the past two years since I rarely use it during the summer, preferring iced drinks rather than hot.

      "I found the references to a filter a bit confusing since there is no filter in my kettle.  I also could not imagine why I would need a filter on a electric kettle anymore than I do on the kettles that I use on a stove.  There is a stainless steel insert in the spout which I thought was to help minimize splashing. Anything in the water would have to be fairly large to be captured by this insert.\n",

      "Plastic is not my preference so I bought this. It is good for protein drinks but my handheld blender is too big for this. I really wanted this for when im away from home which is why I bought the handheld mixer but this is ok for making them at home in my blender and does keep the drink cold however I ended up ordering one of those protein shakers with lid which is enroute and hopefully that will work good for when im away. Otherwise this seems ok for using at home.\n",

      "It is a stainless steel drink cup. I am happy with it in terms of being what it is supposed to be. I have a 'Hamilton Beech Commmercial' single spindle mixer. It works ok with it, but it doesn't engage the 'lip switch' so when you put it in you can't just leave it there and have it on, you need to use the toggle up top. Would have been better if it fit.\n",

      "Works as expected.\n",
      "I use this every day and it works great. We converted to the electric kettle from a standard stove-top kettle. It uses less energy to bring the water to a boil than it would on the stove. Also because it heats up quicker, it saves just that much more energy because it's on for less time. My only complaint is that it is a bit hard to read the measurements while it is held under the faucet but this is so minor because it really doesn't pose a problem when filling or pouring.\n",
      "Amazon order history shows I purchased this on March 30, 2010. I am still using it. Why only 3 stars?\n",
      "\n",
      "It actually has served me well, with everything working as advertised; long ago, however, I noticed prolific discoloration at the bottom of the pot. \"People say\" discoloration is normal for this type of kettle after some use. But living in a municipality with notoriously soft water (Seattle), this seemingly isn't due to the common scapegoat, hard water. To me the discoloration looks conspicuously like rust, and I for one would rather not be consuming oxidized metals (at any ppm) more than is unavoidable in everyday living. I finally broke down and bought a different brand, and will post a review if I experience the same problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Correct me if I am wrong, but doesn't \"stainless\" imply an absence of stains? If you don't believe the discoloration is rust, then consider this a 5-star item.\n",
      "We love this and use it every day, multiple times a day. (Big tea drinkers). My only issue has been that the automatic lever doesn't always pop up when the water is boiling. 90% of the time it does and the rest of the time it just keeps on boiling till my kitchen gets steamy. We just pull it out from under the cupboards so they don't get wet if this happens. But honestly, I'm usually standing by waiting for the water so it's not a big deal. We love that our 13 and 10 year old can make their own hot drinks, oatmeal or even Ramen without having to turn on the gas stove.\n",
      "Works wonderfully.\n",
      "worked great on my xmas turkey.  my old plastic one broke on its first use. this one appears as if it will be around for years.\n",
      "the needles are THICK, which it came with two sizes instead of 2 diff styles. but it's high quality and thank god it comes with extra o-rings. haven't needed them yet but be sure to dry it so it doesnt damage the rings over time\n",
      "I use it with a hand held blender to make bulletproof coffee.\n",
      "So far the  kettle has performed well. However when heating up to boil, before it reaches it makes a louder than usual noise. I am  not sure why. It still works well. Looks very classy on the counter top. Easy to clean.\n",
      "We had this Electric Kettle for over 2 years and it works great. Heats water very fast, is light and is easy to clean.\n",
      "The only improvement we can think of is for it to shut off sooner. It keeps running for 30 secs after water has started boiling\n",
      "not as nice as the older model, but still works well.\n",
      "works quickly, but not quietly!  I was surprised by how loud it gets to bring the water to boil, but it doesn't really bother us - it's convenient to have in the office.  If you need quiet, you might have to try a different brand...\n",
      "After using several times noticed the water does not remain hot for long because the heat escape through the sprout. Needs to be turned on several times\n",
      "Not as sturdy as our former Aroma model, which I dropped and broke after four years of use, but great bang for the buck. We use this every day for tea, coffee, water to clean the sink or drain, soaking water for dried foods, oatmeal, etc. Love this appliance.\n",
      "Does the job.\n",
      "Very nice. Works great with my emersion stick. Perfect for my smoothies. Every kitchen should have this.\n",
      "as others have said rust easily crap\n",
      "Arrived timely and exactly as described. No problems.\n",
      "Fantastic for mixing milkshakes\n",
      "the best injector I've ever bought.\n",
      "I believe I received a knockoff. Not in Bayu Classic packaging like in the photo. Looks cheap and had Amazons sku sticker on side of a gray unmarked box that said it was Bayu Classic. Will be returning due to suspicion. I attached photos.\n",
      "Aroma is my favorite brand. This is my 3rd kettle from Aroma. My first 2 quit working after several years.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like the simple design and it is very easy to use.\n",
      "Worked well for intermittent use for the first few years. I recently switched completely to drinking tea every morning and after about 2 months of daily use it stopped shutting off automatically when boiling.  Then after another 6 months the electrical contacts in the base wore out so that it won't reliably heat water.\n",
      "\n",
      "For $30 I suppose that's about what can expect in terms of lifespan.  Now that I'm a daily user, I'll probably replace it with something that is higher end and will hopefully last longer.\n",
      "Very fast heating of water!!\n",
      "Very good. Works as advertised.\n",
      "We use this hot pot every single day..It comes in handy for so many things.. A great purchase.\n",
      "great quality\n",
      "Solid.\n",
      "Nice and sturdy.  Feels like it should cost more than it did.  I have used this about 6 times so far with great success every time.  Cleaning is very simple.  They also included some extra O rings for when the first ones get worn out.\n",
      "Very sturdy, nice injector. However, be sure that all the needle holes are inside of the turkey. If not, your marinade will be all over your floor.\n",
      "This product works as advertised. I do not like that you can not see through the canister. I did end up buying a gun injector after using this so this is going to be a back up unit.\n",
      "will use it soon\n",
      "Love it!\n",
      "Works really well with a hand immersion blender wand I bought for small, quick kitchen recipes. Shape really helps to froth and blend really quickly.\n",
      "Perfect for mess-free mixing\n",
      "A nice sized cup for my protein shakes, very sturdy and well constructed stainless steel cup.\n",
      "Has a very nice finish, good size and easy to grip.\n",
      "I'm giving it five stars for construction and appearance  but I was tempted to give it only three\n",
      "because of the gummy sticker that was a real chore to remove. Why do companies do that?\n",
      "The third one I have bought. The first survived 4 years of constant use, the second lasted a year.  I use it at least 6 times a day, everyday.  Love this kettle.\n",
      "I love this!  Fast, easy to use.  I bought it for hot tea but find myself using it whenever I need hot water quickly rather than heating on the stove or microwave.\n",
      "I can't say I spent a great deal of time reading reviews before my purchase but I ultimately decided on this kettle. Regrettable choice. The base is light and a flimsy, so flimsy that its a struggle to have it lay nicely on the counter with the cord bopping around. The spout is glued on and I can see where the glue is. I like that it is stainless steel and there is not any plastic on the inside, but it feels cheap and looks cheap. I sucked up the inconvenience to return and try again. A waste of time.\n",
      "No problem using it, it's not too heavy, boils water very fast, the wireless design works great. No complaints\n",
      "Let me start by saying that I don't know what took me so long to find this.  For years, every stinking year I bought a glass or plastic syringe to shoot the turkey up with homemade turkey stock at Thanksgiving. Every stinking year the glass or plastic would crack by the last baste if not before.  This year I found this one. Worked perfectly, washed up great with a bottle brush and is very heavy duty. No glass or plastic to break.  I will probably have this for years to come.\n",
      "The one I received has long indentations, four total, running down the sides.  Almost looks like it was once paired with some kind of machine and those were used to hold the cup in place.  Doesn't effect how this works it just answers why this is so inexpensive.  Oh and of course the \"made in China\" sticker.  Seems ok so far, nothing special but it should do the trick.\n",
      "Great just right size.\n",
      "She loves it!!!\n",
      "Perfect drinking cup allowing me to put away likely harmful plastic from cheap cups bought at dollar store.\n",
      "Great value\n",
      "I have two-one for the office and one for home.  The home one is used on a daily basis for the past two years and it boils water quicker than on the stove.  Sometimes when needing boiling water for cooking pasta-I boil water in this pot and transfer to stove to save time.  The stainless cleans easily.\n",
      "Fastest hot water ever. Clean and simple design.\n",
      "bought as a gift for brother,  he has called me several times over that past several years to say how much he loves it!!\n",
      "I love this electric kettle. It heats up water so quickly! Highly recommend.\n",
      "Absolutely love that the filter is built into the device. My old models the filter would deteriorate so quickly.\n",
      "I like the auto shut-off but don't like the plastic inside.  I was looking for all stainless steel.  It is a workhorse for people who don't mind the plastic.\n",
      "Amazing quality!\n",
      "Only used it once and so far its working great. I love how easy it is to use. I still need to find a good to clean it though. Overall, so far I would recommend. Good product\n",
      "Excellent product\n",
      "works great\n",
      "I was surprised at the quality. Very nice.\n",
      "WORKS GOOD\n",
      "Fun to make the old fashioned shake in this.\n",
      "This is perfect for my hand-held blender.  The plastic container it came with cracked but this seems like it will last forever.  It's an efficient design - takes up less space than the pitcher I considered.  Since I'm low budget, I thought it over for quite a while, but it's a good weight of stainless steel so not overpriced.  I'm glad to have it.\n",
      "Perfect for a hand blender\n",
      "I use this with an immersion blender for smoothies it's great. Easy to wash too.\n",
      "Works great with my wand blender. Sturdy and well made.\n",
      "narrow bottom did not work with our all-clad ss 600 watt immersion blender\n",
      "husband loves this!\n",
      "Good product. It does exactly what it says it does. It boils 2 cups of water in 2 minutes and 6 cups of water in 6 minutes, etc. And it shuts off automatically so I do not have to worry over boiling over or burning the pot. I would recommend it.\n",
      "This is my second purchase for this particular hot water maker. It heats water exceptionally fast and is very easy to use and very safe. I purchased the second one as a gift. I am considering a third purchase for a bathroom to cold water is not wasted to obtain hot in the bathroom sink!\n",
      "I brought this kettle a little over two years ago, and it worked wonderfully. Alas, this morning water leaked out all over the desk. The seal in the kettle is broken. I would have thought it would last longer than two years.\n",
      "Bought this a little more than 5 years ago for my mother and it has served her well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The included filter was too cumbersome/annoying to leave in place, so that was quickly discarded.\n",
      "\n",
      "The auto-off doesn't seem to work anymore, but that's okay, as long as you're willing to stick around while the thing comes to a boil (which is pretty darned fast!).\n",
      "Well built, heavy, great quality.\n",
      "Works good.  First one I got had a damaged seal and leaked but the replacement is working great.  Tolerances are very tight so there is no leaking.\n",
      "works with thicker injections\n",
      "Perfect for injecting in turkeys, chickens, roasts, etc.\n",
      "Good for limited use, seemed like something my wife would use. She is an experienced chef and I thought these would work well with an immersion blender but they are a bit too narrow. Well made, easy to clean, but not as useful as I had hoped for.\n",
      "I use this with the Ovente 2 Speed 300 Watts 3-in-1 Immersion Hand Blender that I purchased. It had a glass beaker which we also use but I wanted to try this. It's tall enough for whatever I'm blending not to splatter. Easy to clean.\n",
      "The base separated from the kettle after just a few uses--rendering the whole thing unsafe to use.  I've owned quite a few of these kettles, and this is by far the worst.  Would not buy again.\n",
      "Some reviews mention the plastic switch breaking...as long as you press it down easily there is no problem.  This heats the water quickly and is great for my tea and hot chocolate.\n",
      "Bought this one for a friend as a gift because I have used mine nearly everyday for several years and have been so pleased with its performance. I could not imagine giving anything less than this electric kettle as a gift.\n",
      "Heats up quickly & cleans well, per user instructions.\n",
      "I think this is our third such Aroma pot, all purchased from Amazon. My spouse likes a hot pot because he makes instant coffee, and likes to do his Quaker instant oatmeal while the water is hot too.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm trying to recall the features of the other hot pots. This one is slightly different in two features. The first is the top or lid handle. It is shaped differently. The second difference is in the pop-up timing of the on/off device beneath the pot handle. This one stays down until the water boils vigorously. It does not come UP in the meantime, even if you lift the pot off its heating element. Previous pots all clicked off audibly when I lifted them. And, I notice no click sound when it pops up. I have excellent hearing, and rely on sounds made by my small appliances for their state of readiness, or for safety  Other than this small uneasy feeling for a silent click-less hot pot, it performs to expectations.\n",
      "So far so good. It has worked just fine for about one month but this morning I noticed it has just started developing those annoying \"corrosion spots\" on the bottom. I am hesitant to use anything abrasive to remove them. I ONLY use BRITA filtered water in the pot. It heats us quickly (although noisily) and shuts off after about a one-minute boil. I will update if the corrosion gets worse or if it stops working.\n",
      "Photo looks like quality product. One received not so, and extremely large. Would be ok if you are a large strong person who is injecting a row of 45lb Turkeys. Reminds me of horse-cattle shots. Not your compact typical injector. Sending back for refund\n",
      "A decent item, the only thing is a bit difficult to use with hand mixer. So far I have not had a problem.\n",
      "I just had an idea cut an old pair of rubber gloves heavy ones a couple of inches from the cuff would do it.\n",
      "Will review again if my contraption works or I change my mind about item.\n",
      "Other wise could have gone with another 1/2 star rating.\n",
      "I made my purchase after reading reviews.\n",
      "This gets a lot of use in my kitchen! I got two but one has grown legs and is hiding! lol I love that it's easy to clean quickly or if at the end of the day it can go in dishwasher.\n",
      "Nice 30 oz stainless ready to make a  shake.\n",
      "Thick, study cup\n",
      "Good quality milkshake beaker.\n",
      "Good for mixing and drinking those special drinks\n",
      "Got these to use with Braun hand mixer, work great.\n",
      "The kettle heats quickly with no after-flavors and is easy to remove from the base. Being able to pour from the kettle without being tethered by the cord is a nice feature.  Highly recommend this product.\n",
      "Have been using this product for many years. It makes a great present for friends and family. Very practical.\n",
      "works great\n",
      "Great quality but very frustrating to use. The damn thing is so hard to push down once loaded. It became such a hassle I just used the cheap disposable plastic ones.\n",
      "Bigger than i thought lol\n",
      "Works great to mix my coffee drink or protein drinks with an immersion blender. Perfect size\n",
      "Don't know because it was a gift to someone else.\n",
      "Great quality tumbler. 30oz. Heavy duty.\n",
      "Instant coffee and tea at home - plus soups. saves $$$\n",
      "Great water heater.\n",
      "Great Unit!!! Friends don't let friends use cheap injectors.\n",
      "good product\n",
      "The injector works well IF you are injecting fluids( clear stock). If you are using a marinate with seasonings such as chopped garlic, it clogs easliy.\n",
      "I bought this to use with my Hamilton Beach hand blender.  That works.\n",
      "\n",
      "The really disappointing aspect of this cup, is the fact it is two pieces help together sloppily.  I took for granted it would be one piece.  No.  It uses small divots on the bottom to attach to the top piece.  On my cup, there was a sliver of steel protruding INSIDE the cup from one of those divots.  Imagine if I failed to visually inspect the inside of the cup before using it.  I will NOT be buying one of these again.\n",
      "Bought for making bullet proof coffee. You really need to double up a second one otherwise they get pretty hot to the touch.\n",
      "Update... initially, I loved these because they were inexpensive and fit the hand blender perfectly but I had only used one of them...  in the set, 2 of them have a HOLE at the bottom side of the cup where there are metal rivets.  I poured the milk into the cup only to be aurpeozed to see it spout right out the side so I tested them all and 2 have holes!  Not too happy about that but I will use the others.\n",
      "  They are perfect for use with a hand held immersion blender!  Perfect size and exactly what I needed for shakes, smoothies, etc...\n",
      "Did just what I needed it to do\n",
      "love it\n",
      "Thanks\n",
      "The best I ever had,use it all the time....\n",
      "Boils water; lighter than the 8-cup one that it replaced (that leaker - another brand); as I age, I have less strength and old kettle was getting too heavy. Love things that do what they are designed to do.\n",
      "Bought for my sister after they stayed with us.\n",
      "Excellent for the price and u don't see a heating coil inside. This is my 5th. I buy 2 at a time so when I have company there is enough hot water. also have given them to friends who have not seen electric kettles\n",
      "Had previous model that I bought years ago which worked great. This model does not seem as solidly built as the old but works fine and boils water in about 2 minutes\n",
      "Love this.  Nice look, shiny, does not look fake, cleans up well even if splattered; heats water faster than on the stove in my previous whistling kettle - I did a 'scientific' test :)  The only cord is on the base, and the kettle itself even with boiled water in it, may be safety placed onto any surface I can think of.  There's a small round light to tell you it's on / heating after you put the lever down to make it boil.  The lever pops up and it stops heating.\n",
      "The lid releases easily for filling with cold water, and I'm amazed at how it never drips!  What a nice feature on how they built the pour-spout.\n",
      "Great for making iced coffees.\n",
      "I purchased a stick blender that came with a plastic mixing cup. The cup was an unexceptable PBA type plastic. This is a no worry stainless steel. The stick blender fits nicely into the bottom of this for mixing smoothies, dressings, and fruit drinks. Very well made and will last forever. Thick metal will not bend or break. Very easy to wash of course.\n",
      "love this!\n",
      "These are great for milkshakes - I use am immersion blender and then just stick in a straw.\n",
      "Works great with our hand held mixer\n",
      "Functional at a good price but appear to include manufacturing rejects. Ordered 3, all are misshaped - either lopsided or asymmetrical containers set in a solid base. Otherwise they are not bad for a container to use with a hand held blender.\n",
      "Super heavy duty stainless steel marinade injector. This is by far the best one I have ever owned. It is easy to load and use and will last years as it is a quality made product. The two types of needles on it allow for both straight liquid injections and larger holes allowing for minced herbs to be injected. I did not have to puree everything before I put the garlic marinade into the turkey. Great great product. Thank you!\n",
      "Great kit for the price\n",
      "Thanks\n",
      "Use this injector for an over roaster......it came out amazingly juicy! I like the stainless steel..had a plastic one that broke after a few uses.\n",
      "Sure it'll be great!!\n",
      "Worked perfect.\n",
      "I really like this, heats up very quickly, stainless steel all the way through, and very easy to use. Only complaint would be that it's a bit difficult to clean the inside of the kettle without getting water around the electrical part, and the opening is a bit too small to easily fit your hand inside to clean using a sponge.\n",
      "Perfect for making smoothies and shakes the old fashioned way. Acai with frozen blueberries and peaches--no mess.\n",
      "stainless excellence.\n",
      "Good quality no complaints.\n",
      "I like this item but it would be nice to have an easy pour spout on it.\n",

      "Packed and shipped well, arrived on time and ready to use.  Simple straight forward operations and easy to clean.\n",
      "A gift for a guy who has everything! He had been looking for metal ones and was so surprised I got them for him! I went all BBQ for him!\n",
      "I've now used this daily for several years, and it remains one of my favorite small appliances. It boils water very quickly, and is sleek and simple.  I occasionally boil some white vinegar mixed with water in it to clear out any mineral deposits, and then rinse well.\n",
      "Works like a charm!  The ONLY reason I'm not giving it five stars is the manufacturer can't make up its mind on the spout screen design.  One reviewer mentions a removable plastic screen.  I have two.  The first had a very nice stainless steel screen, fixed in place.  The second ( newer) one came with  a fixed-in-place perforated metal one, not unlike a colander.  I really prefer the screen, it is far more effective as a filtering device.\n",
      "gift\n",
      "We love our smoothies from these metal tumblers. We just use our hand blender with each of the two we own to make healthful, delicious, icy cold drinks.\n",
      "Perfect blending cup.  I use it several times a week for my Bulletproof Coffee.  It's the perfect size for just about anything you want to use an emulsion blender for.  Love it.\n",
      "Very good quality cup for quick sauce and small quantity preparations.\n",
      "This is not a one piece design. Cheap.\n",

      "Wonderful price, impeccable product, speedy delivery, and pleasant to buy from.. will be a long term customer!\n",
      "This was a scary looking item. However, we use it on every brisket.\n",
      "Arrived to late but still kept it will use in the future when I deep fry my turkeys...\n",
      "Exactly what I expected. Great looking product.\n",

      "Ps: If you want to save money, it might be cheaper at your local target. Sometimes they have promotions.\n",
      "I like this pot.  It heats to a full boil pretty quickly.  The heated water pours out easily and without spilling.  The cord wraps around and stores underneath the pot.  I have since seen a Breville pot that has a retractable cord and that would have been nice.  My other slight frustration is the opening at the top for pouring in the water.  It is a bit small and I have spilled water pouring it into the pot.  Otherwise I am very happy with this purchase and feel it was a reasonable price.\n",
      "A-ok\n",

      "Yup, it's just what we wanted!  And at a sharp price!\n",

I now have a pot with a top that cannot lock - looks broken off, somewhat... I would not recommend buying any of their products in the future - as they like Oster another mfg... the name is the same, the product is not....\n",

      "Love my stainless cup!\n",
      "You can blend stuff in here and no one gets injured as long as they keep their fingers out. It's rough, it's tough, it holds smoothies and milk shakes. It takes all the power my hand blender can dish out and it never complains.\n",

      "worked great for 3 years in a household of four people, used about 5-10x/day, but the thermostat just stopped working and the kettle no longer turns itself off, so it wastes a lot of energy and requires a little babysitting, but it still boils water. Customer service informed me that Aroma does not repair these kettles or stock parts for it, so my only option is to replace it. Wasteful! I would have given it 5 stars had it not broken so soon, or had it been serviceable. Besides this durability issue, the only other imperfection in this kettle is the small section of plastic that comes in contact with the water.\n",
      "Worked great nearly every single day for the past 4 years, but recently the base has started to melt. Seems like a fairly unsafe way to end its life.\n",
      "Blanket is not a very good quality.  Very thin. Disappointing.\n",
      "Just as described Thanks\n",
      "I was making jello shots and didn't want to spend $23 on the \"Jellinator\" since I'm not a college bro and will probably never need to make jello shots again. Using this I filled up 64 2oz containers in about 5 minutes without spilling a drop, and as a plus, now I have a well made marinade and seasoning injector. If I bought the \"Jellinator\" for easy jello shot pouring I would've ended up with a $23 piece of plastic in the end that would end up in a land fill or cluttering up my kitchen.\n",
      "Works great. Easy to clean\n",
      "I bought this with my turkey fryer.  It looks pretty intimidating.  Works well.\n",
      "Small needle does not fit syringe.  Threads too small\n",
      "Great\n",

      "Crap.\n",

      "The lid does have plastic on the inside and in the filter holder.\n",
      "Great device for making hot water.\n",
      "Just bought our 2nd one of these. I wrote the date of purchase on the 1st one... it lasted 16 months. So they are cheap Chinese home appliances and I now know not to expect it to last that long. That said... I really wish it did last as they are so useful and much preferred to the tea kettles on the stove that can burn out. This one shuts off when the water boils and it heats up that water pretty darn fast. I like that the heating element is separate from the kettle. Have my fingers crossed this one lasts longer.\n",
      "Can't comment due to returned\n",
      "OMG  the Turkey was great.\n",
      "I made \"Turkey Dope\" and shot it up on Monday and cooked it on Thursday.  Lovely Thanksgiving bird.\n",
      "It was moist and delicious, everyone really liked it leaving not too much as leftovers.\n",
      "For a medium sized bird, about 16 pounds....a stick of salted butter, 1/2 teaspoon ground sage, 1 tablespoon of McCormick Poultry Seasoning (Thyme, Sage, Marjoram, Rosemary, Black Pepper and Nutmeg.) 1 teaspoons of salt, 1/2 teaspoon of pepper and 1/2 tsp of onion powder.  Melted and mixed together and then this dope was injected in multiple spots with lots into  the legs.  It seems to have moved through the bird and everything was just right.\n",
      "Fantastic injector.  This is one of the more inexpensive ones on Amazon, but it is very high quality. It is packaged very nicely, and there are extra seals/O rings for each nozzle and for the main chamber plunger.  It is solid, and easy to use.  It comes apart for easy cleaning, too.  I used it on Thanksgiving to inject a turkey that was smoked.  My only minor complaint is that the holes that go up the side of the nozzle to inject the liquids maybe go up a little too high.  When you're injecting the meat, you need to make sure the nozzle is inserted past the last hole, otherwise the liquid will spray out of the exposed hole.  This isn't a problem for most of the turkey that I was injecting, but there were a few spots where it was tricky to insert it deep enough.\n",
      "I'm so happy that I went with this injector vs other ones.  I initially bought this one for the two different needles, but was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package to find additional replacement gaskets.  If you've read reviews on various needles, you'll come to find out that gaskets are the #1 reason for failure for these style of injectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, I've used my injector mulitple times with great success, this one was definitely worth the coin.\n",
      "I use this every day to heat coffee or tea water.  The water heats fast and what I don't use stays warm for quite awhile.  I bought another one for a friend.  It is the best.\n",
      "gf42\n",
      "I bought this inexpensive electric tea kettle for work. I put it out in the public area and this kettle must get used at least 15 times a day. Years later it is still going strong with no problems of any kind. It's kind of amazing. I highly recommend it.\n",
      "great product. boils quick, a bit loud though. Had to turn up Sons of Anarchy on my TV to hear the dialogue while this kettle was on.\n",
      "Works great\n",
      "Perfect as a stainless steel mixing cup for my immersion blender!\n",
      "great product\n",
      "Great product! Arrived on time!\n",
      "Works great on my Waring PDM104.  The ones I got were high quality with no defects.  I can't talk to the issues other people had.  If you're concerned about people saying that they're not stainless you should know that many stainless alloys are not magnetic.  The ones I received are definitely a high quality stainless steel.\n",
      "I cannot say anything negative about this cup. I love the way water tastes in steel cups, since steel doesn't hold the scent or taste of a previous drink. It keeps cold drinks nice and frosty. It is large enough for a nice big smoothie or shake.  This particular tumbler is durable and dishwasher safe.\n",
      "This cup is great for coffee, tea, smoothies and whatever else you want to put in it. The capacity is just right for someone who drinks a lot.\n",
      "I bought this for my daughter-in-law to go with her new Turkey Deep Fryer and was very surprised at how classy it looked. It came in a nice package that made it look like a very expensive kitchen accessory. If it works as good as it looks, she will love it!\n",
      "First of all the overall quality is fine, it's all metal (alloy of some type) construction was exactly what I expected. O-rings are not plastic as the highest rated negative review indicates. Not sure if they are reviewing the wrong product, if amazon bunched two different items into the same review pool which they do all to often, or if something has changed since that time but the o-rings are a rubber like material as you would expect. The only issue I have and my reason for rating three stars and not higher is that the O-rings cannot handle heat so in my case re-injecting my turkey as it was cooking became an impossible task. There was no leaking but even with lubrication (ie. various types of food grade oils like olive oil or vegetable oil on the ring) the plunger would seize in the chamber and not be able to move at all until I disassembled the injector cooled it off and re-lubricated the ring. Worked great for the initial injection but not for while the food is cooking.\n",
      "So, first timer here trying to inject a turkey.  Used the needle with multiple holes since my sauce was liquid mostly (no chunks etc), and I wanted the best saturation I could get.  Perhaps there were instructions somewhere (I didn't look very hard), but either they are hidden/missing, or I was just too excited to start sticking that bird.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anywho, I stick it in deep, plunge, then extract to stick to a new area.  WARNING!!! As soon as the first hole in the needle comes out, all the pressure you just created in the bird comes squirting back out that hole.  Maybe some one-way valves would help, but eventually, stuff leaks.\n",
      "Superb quality.  Use it every night to make our tea.  It's fast and easy to use and sure beats the microwave or the old kettle on the stove.  I saw this all over Europe and that is why I got it.\n",
      "Does a great job so far.\n",
      "Fabulous!  It heats water very quickly.  The pot is a beautiful addition to my kitchen.  I would definitely buy this product again.  I love the on and off switch and that it is cordless when lifted off its base. The water level indicator is a little hard to see but easy to get used to.\n",
      "We have had one of these for awhile and use it for hot water several times a day.  We sent one to our son who had used it on a recent visit and liked it.  He uses it a lot, and says it works great... as does ours.  We never have to worry about hot water or leaving an appliance on... it cuts off automatically.... and reheats the water in seconds.\n",
      "LOVE THIS.  Water heats up fast and its neat.  Perfect permanent fixture in my kitchen!\n",
      "I purchased this kettle April 13, 2013 and it died January 21, 2015. I don't know why but these things do not last very long for me.  I did not do anything to it and it just died, same as the last two I have owned.  I do not know what the average life of a kettle is but it seems short to me.  I do use the kettle, no fail, every single day, at least once per day.  If anyone else has this problem with short lifespan of these kettles, or has found a kettle that last longer than a year or two, would you please reply to this review?  Thank you.\n",

I did not preform any tests with these, but from my experience I think they will hold up well.

      "\n",
      "The pitcher is metal, which is great against heat. But I had to knock off a star because the underside of the lid, where its inside the kettle, is plastic. Plastic doesn't do well to rapid heat up/cool down so this is likely to crack. Also the joint which controls the opening of the lid is plastic. My last kettle also had this, and after a year of frequent use it popped off and I had to buy a new one.\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT (4/28/2015) After 4 months the kettle has started malfunctioning.  Won't turn off automatically, if you leave it on its base and flip off the switch it is STILL heating the water.  Still usable but not very convenient and a fire hazard....\n",
      "My kettle is at least 5 years old. I boil water for coffee and tea 4-7 times a day. I wanted to replace it because it was in a fire almost 2 years ago and part of the handle was slightly melted. I actually purchased a new one with the insurance money after the fire, but the bright blue light of that model drove me nuts, so I returned it (Target). Over time, it did seem that the shut off didn't work as well. Recently, also, the lid was not closing tight. I cleaned calcium deposits with vinegar and it made it look prettier, but didn't close or shut off better. I just timed it, and with only .5L of water in it, it takes a full minute of boiling before it shuts off. After reading a series of negative reviews about the kettle here while contemplating replacement, I decided to wait it out a little longer, and try to fix what I have some more. I took the bottom off (3 screws) and found considerable residue of the fire extinguishing powder that was still in there, checked out the shut off mechanism (if that's what it is, there must be a sensor somewhere too?). I also lubricated the clips that are supposed to hold the lid down (never use lubricants on plastic, it doesn't work). I even cut off some plastic because two parts seemed to scrape against each other while opening and closing. I open/closed the lid about 50 times and thanks to the lube, it's now harder to open and close, which may just be what I needed. I put everything back together and then did a test to see how long it takes to boil 1,5L of water (a question somewhere else for another kettle, which took 7 mins). It takes my kettle 6.5 minutes to come to a full boil (visible and audible). It now took only 15 additional seconds for it to shut off. To make sure, I tried it again with only .5L of boiling water, and it shut off again after 15 seconds. I guess I will not be buying a new one yet and just put up with the somewhat melted handle until it really stops working.\n",
      "Bought this Nov. 2009 and it's still going strong! The previous expensive brand-name kettle stopped working soon after the 90 day warranty so I went down-scale with this one, I thought. Turns out I should have bought this one to begin with. Everything still works though I took the \"filter\" screen off, my water is good so I don't need some thing like that. Easy to clean, heats quickly and I use it daily for hot tea (gave up coffee so long ago). And I really like the retro percolator look.\n",
      "I purchased this unit in December 2012.  I use it at work, probably 3-4 days a week.  It's worked fine, although the small opening makes it hard to get my hand in to clean or demineral the kettle.  My biggest complaint is it is rusting, inside at the base, below the handle, and even when I scrubbed the rust off it just rusts again.  I don't leave standing water in it, and I always leave the top ajar when it's not in use.  Mineral build-up was expected, even using bottled or filtered water, but the rusting at the inside base was not.  I'm not a big fan of consuming rust, so I won't be using this any more.  Is 2 years a good lifespan for this item?  I don't really think so, considering the relatively light use it got.  Other than the rusting issue, it's worked fine.\n",
      "Good size and sturdy enough for my Cuisinart immersible blender.\n",
      "Just what I wanted\n",
      "It's ok, I should have ordered a taller one. my mistake\n",
      "Pairs great with hand mixer for puree-ing fruits and yogurt.\n",
      "Great product.  I love that it's all stainless steel and comes with two different basting injectors.  Works like a charm on all of my meats.\n",
      "I finally had a chance to use this item and its defective. I checked to see if i could return it but i can't. The injector has no threads to screw on the injector needles. It's useless and not worth the purchase.  What a waste of money.\n",

      "We've had ours for over 5 years and it works like new.  Probably use it twice a day.\n",
      "I bought this kettle when I moved into my dorm room at college. Over 6 years of daily use and 4 apartments later, this kettle is still going strong!\n",
      "\n",
      "This kettle is much more efficient than using a pot or kettle on the stove. I just timed it, and for the max 1.5 liters it takes just 5 minutes for the water to start steaming. This is the point at which I'd usually shut the water off, because I prefer it to be below boiling for steeping tea. To reach the full boil and automatic shutoff it took 6.25 minutes. However, this is for 1.5 liters which makes probably around 5-6 servings. When I just need enough for one cup, it is much faster.\n",
      "\n",
      "The design of this kettle is great. The stainless steel is attractive enough that I don't mind leaving it out in the open. This is important, since I use it every day! It's also very convenient that the kettle itself is cordless. When I have guests over, I'll usually heat up a full pot of water and then bring it out to the living room to refill everyone's cups. The fact that this is electric and doesn't rely on the stove also makes it much more flexible. I've had it sitting on the kitchen counter in the past, but due to my current very cramped kitchen layout I actually have it out in the dining room.\n",
      "\n",
      "The water level indicator on the side is very handy for figuring out if I need to refill it or not. I also haven't had any problems with buildup or a funny taste, even after 6 years of heavy usage.\n",

      "There are other more expensive kettles with more features, but I don't think you can go wrong with this one for the price.\n",

      "This thing heats up an entire pot of water faster than my Keurig 2.0 heats up a single cup of water for coffee... whats up with that!?  This thing is great!\n",
      "I just got this kettle a week ago and within a few days the auto shut off has stopped working. My whole reason for getting an electric kettle is so that I can turn it on and walk away from it, knowing it will turn off once the water boiled. Today it started leaking from the bottom. Ahh!! Poorly made and will not buy again...not worth the risk. I contacted Amazon to return it and they are wonderful - they always repond quickly to me and are so accomodating.\n",

      "After this was suggested on a review of my Cuisinart Blender Stick, I realize just how much I love it.  It looks classy and does the job well.  No metallic taste when blending acids such as berries.  It looks like the old soda shop blender cups\n",

      "bought this to inject seasoning in my turkey for thanksgiving... the seasoning was difficult to squeeze through and I wound up with several pockets of injected flavoring instead of a nice even flavoring throughout the bird...\n",

      "Awesome investment. I loved mine so much I bought one for my parent's and they have told me many times that this was their favorite gift. I also bought one for my daughter and she uses it for her baby bottles and milk. It heats up instantly so she can warm bottles in a glass bowl in seconds. You can make oatmeal and grits or instant coffee. I use mine every day many times a day. I also use it to make my tea. I just boil half a pot of water. Once it is done pour it over one family size tea bag in a sauce pot and cover with a lid. Let it steep until it is cool. Then I make a pitcher of iced tea. I fill the tea pitcher with the tea from the pot and 3/4 cup of sugar and add water to the top and mix. This makes half gallon pitcher of southern iced sweet tea! I am a southern girl and make one pitcher a day! This pot has all kinds of uses for me put keeps me from having to stand over the stove with a pot. IT is safe and fast! Thank you\n",
      "Awesome!  So nice not to have to deal with the cord all the time.  The clear fill indicator is great.  I use it often and have never had a problem with it.\n",
      "It's Great that it shuts off automatically.\n",
      "The worst thing ever.  The needle with the multiple holes is pretty much worthless unless you have a big turkey and you stick in all the way in the breasts.  There are so many holes so far apart that I couldn't use it on my chickens.  The needle with the single hole at the tip that gives the impression that you can use marinades with particles in them wasn't even able to push water through without having to use all the strength I had.  I tried two different marinades and even with putting the handle on a solid service and pushing down with all my might I could not get anything to go through.  Neither one had anything solid in it.  I took the needle off and after pushing as hard as I could it exploded the sauce all over the place.  Biggest waste of money.\n",

      "Its a nice glass, and I'm sure it serves its purpose. That being said, I bought this under the impression that it was a cocktail shaker, and it most definitely is not. The ridges in the glass leave gaps when you try to shake anything. This would be great for milkshakes if I had a blender, although that's about all it would be good for\n",

      "Amazingly fast, a little loud in our quiet environment. We have had ours operating our float spa making tea six to eight times a day for three years and it works great.  I don't know what happened the other day, but after I made tea I needed to refill it and the lid stuck.  I pulled and then pulled again and I literally ripped the lid off the kettle. I don't know why it happened, it's never gotten stuck before. It still works but looks terrible, like WALL-E on a bad day.\n",

      "This has been a great little gadget for our household.  It's lifesaver for hectic mornings when all you want is a cup of coffee or tea and be out the door without waiting for a conventional kettle to heat up or wondering all day if you left the burner on.  Boiling time is very quick and efficient.  We've had our model for a couple of years and it's still going strong with no issues.  Mineral buildup is treated with vinegar soaks and it's good as new.  The size is perfect for a couple or small family. I've purchased this for family members and overall, this particular model seems to be the best reviewed electric kettle.\n",
      "works great\n",
      "I got used to the convenience of having an electric water kettle when I lived in Europe, where every kitchen has one.\n",

      "When I moved back to the States I chose this Aroma kettle, and I've been totally pleased. It does everything I expect from it, and it does it well. I've had mine about 8 years now, no problems, and I use it at least 3 times a day on average for making tea, a coffee press, instant oatmeal, etc. No complaints!\n",
      "\n",
      "It brings cold tap water to a boil very fast. Once it boils, it shuts itself off automatically. This cannot accidentally boil itself dry.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not obvious in the photos, but 'cordless' means there's no cord on the kettle itself. The cord goes to a round base on which the kettle sits while heating. Once it boils, you lift the kettle off the base (you can walk into the next room with the kettle itself if you want).\n",
      "\n",
      "Workmanship is solid. It pours easily and without spills. The top is just large enough to allow an adult man's hand inside to clean (which you won't normally need to do). The stainless exterior is easy to wipe clean.\n",
      "There's a narrow clear vertical window where the handle attaches which allows you to see how much water is in it, with markings of .9 L, 1.2 L, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "This 'Aroma' brand is widely available, online and in all the big box discount retail stores, at prices from around $20 up. Made in China.\n",
      "\n",
      "If mine died tomorrow, I would immediately buy the exact same Aroma model to replace it. I'm totally pleased, no complaints, and for once there's nothing I would change in the design. It just works, looks pleasantly inconspicuous on the counter, doesn't take up a lot of footprint, and I'm totally pleased with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: the AROMA is made in China. What appears to be the same exact identical kettle is also sold under the Brentwood, Chef's Choice and perhaps other brand names as well, all made in China. So if you're shopping price, you might look at those brand names as well.\n",

      "I hope this review is helpful as you comparison shop electric water boilers. Happy tea and coffee making, everybody.\n",
      "Absolutely perfect. Gets the job done.\n",
      "Great\n",
      "I bought this when I bought the turkey fryer. This allowed me to injected my garlic sauce into the turkey and it works great. Stainless steel makes it easy to clean. There are two separate nozzles one for direct injection and the other to inject in the tip as well as the sides. I've used both.\n",
      "I found it worked well with:\n",
      "Turkey\n",
      "Chicken\n",
      "Roast Beef\n",
      "Roast Pork\n",
      "I even tried it on a Meatloaf and meatballs.\n",
      "Fantastic.\n",
      "Nice and good price. Have not used yet\n",
      "Heats water very quickly. Light weight pot. Lid doesn't open all the way very easily, and does not appear to come off, so pouring in water from my britta can be just a little awkward, but is really not a problem, just an FYI. I am sooo happy to have this!!!! It's only been 2 days, but I recommend this product.\n",
      "perfect, exactly what we expected, works great\n",
      "Quality of these cups are great. They have quickly replaced our other drinking vessels. Very versatile and they have been doing fine in the dishwsher. I look forward to many more years of use.\n",
      "Really Nice and Heavy weight quality.\n",
      "woot!  Well constructed\n",
      "This is a fine item, but much smaller than I had thought.  It will be fine for 8 - 12 oz to be pureed with the immersion blender.  It will not work with more than that as the contents will spill over the top when the blender gets them moving.  I need one twice this size.\n",
      "Finally, I found this \"New-Commercial-Grade\" stainless steel cup that would accept my handheld blender head. I meanwhile used this cup no more then 5 times for that purpose, with great satisfaction. However, \"Update International\" (what's in a name?) does not warn against temperature differences for its stainless-steel \"New-Commercial-Grade\" cup. I kept in it a liquid for a day in the refrigerator, took it out to pour, and immediately rinse the cup under warm water for cleaning. - PANG! - The top rim cracked in two places (see pictures). What an unbelievable big disappointment for this \"New-Commercial-Grade\" stainless steel cup. If it had cracked at the bottom, I would have been forewarned as another reviewer wrote about that, but cracking in two places at the top? Lastly, the product is advertised as originating from the US. So, is this really where our product quality standards are headed with product descriptions like \"New-Commercial-Grade\"? Maybe someone can point me to a \"Former-Household-Grade\"?\n",
      "these are great\n",
      "Excellent.\n",
      "I purchased this set for my husband and he loved it. The quality is excellent and it washes well. Highly recommend and would definitely purchase this set again.\n",
      "I purchased this to inject apple cider into a pork butt.  Unfortunately it's the only time I've used it so far.  But it worked great.  The needles were nice and sharp, and it comes apart to clean easily.  Even came with spare gaskets.\n",
      "I've used this several times to make pulled pork. I just inject liquid smoke into the pork butt a few hours before putting it on the smoker. It works perfectly and its easy to use and clean.\n",
      "worked as advertised\n",
      "Used for the first time tonight on whole roasted chicken. Easy to use, clean and made the chicken tender and juicy.\n",
      "works great and saves me so much time making my french press coffee in the morning!\n",
      "I have bought several of these in the past and loved them. The most recent one has a design change I don't like: the switch no longer turns off automatically when you lift the unit. Not a big deal but it can take 30-45 second of full boil to turn off automatically otherwise. Other than that, still a very good design.\n",
      "Economical and useful.  It boils water faster than the stove and uses less energy!  The power cradle make this kettle very simple to use.  Couldn't ask for much more for such a simple and useful device!\n",
      "While I've since bought a new kettle, this little friend served me long and well. I used it long, I used it hard, and I probably used it well past any reasonable amount.\n",
      "\n",
      "This kettle lived with three other housemates and myself and was in near-constant use for three long years (I think). If it had occurred to me at the time, I would have reordered this very same kettle.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't. I like the new kettle because it's pretty flashy and cute, but time will tell if it can live up to the larger-than-life shadow of its predecessor.... this kettle.\n",
      "\n",
      "RIP, Aroma Hot H20 X-Press. You are loved.\n",
      "Sturdy, won't chip like glass, or crack like brittle plastic. Great for using with my 25-year-old Hamilton Beach stick blender. Hope these things last at least half as long. Also good for beer--the foam doesn't spill over the rim.\n",
      "Product is well crafted and was promptly delivered.  Very pleased!\n",
      "These cups are fine. They are a nice size to use with my hand blender. But they were all jammed together when they came and it took me about an hour of chilling the inner one of the stack and heating the outer ones to get them apart. So I won't be buying these again.\n",
      "Very sturdy, beautiful polished stainless steel cups.\n",
      "This is a wonderful accessory for the immersion blender I bought. Deep enough, easy to clean, this is great!\n",
      "This works well because it's SS.  Plastic doesn't hold up.\n",
      "Works great along with good quality!\n",
      "awesome product! the needle is big enough not to clog easily with spices in the marinade. VERY sturdy design. Best one I have ever owned.\n",
      "AWESOME stainless steel construction through and through!  Heavy duty silicone gasket around the plunger is the only non SS part.  Easy to clean and use with any injectable.\n",
      "Inside bottom is plastic!?  We got one of these in our office kitchen, I thought it was really great because I thought it was all steel inside, so I got one for my home to try and save on electric over using the stove.  After a few years of use at work, the bottom inside is all peeling off!!  It's a chrome plastic layer of some kind, the material underneath is a dark-greenish that looks like old, stained plastic.  Maybe it's ceramic, but that doesn't fix the problem of the plastic chrome layer I thought was metal.  :(  I AM UTTERLY DISGUSTED.\n",
      "\n",
      "I drink tea every day.  I can't believe how much I have drank out of this thing and what I've been exposed to.  I believed it was metal.  Today I saw small flakes in my mug after pouring, which led me to examine the inside of the pot.  There is quite a lot of that chrome plastic layer missing, with peeled up flaking edges, and big patches of whatever it is under it showing.  I have no idea how much of that chrome plastic layer I may have drank without noticing, it flaked out quite small and would pass for loose tea leaves if not examining the pot.  UNBELIEVABLE AND ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!!\n",
      "\n",
      "There are so many positive reviews here, many of which state that they bought it for being metal instead of plastic.  This is shocking that the bottom was chrome plastic all along.  They should have to refund all of us!\n",
      "\n",
      "Sickening!\n",
      "So far so good!  I bought this one, because my last Aroma pot had a push button to pop the lid which broke over time.  I try to be gentle with it, since it doesn't feel super sturdy....but heats water fast, it's a good size since I'm always boiling water for my tea, so I don't boil more than 2 cups.\n",
      "\n",
      "*UPDATE*\n",
      "To get rid of film that has developed, I just boiled distilled white vinegar about 3x and it came right off beautifully.  Not as stubborn as with other pots. I'm DEFINITELY happy with this one. Although the lid feels a bit flimsy, so I'm trying to be careful with it!\n",
      "Had this three months and no rust. Need I say more? They all rust at some point but this one is holding up well.  Works great!\n",
      "Well I have not used it as yet but it looks and feels well constructed.  I do have a question about the rubber rings not having used something like this before.  Duh, any one know exactly how to place them and why?\n",
      "This works great and easy to clean. Works perect for injecting them pork shoulders.\n",
      "Perfect tool\n",
      "The gasket is too tight and it is difficult to reassemble and use the plunger after assembly.\n",
      "This is not stainless steel.  Parts of it might be stainless, but the female threads on the syringe tube where it meets the injector threads is pitting and brittle.  This is not stainless.  The underside of the plunger syringe cap has also worn off a thin layer of some metal, and it is corroding.  If this were stainless you should be able to remove the rust (if any) and it would revert to the original finish if polished.  This is simply not the case.  Some of these parts are plated.  The point in buying stainless steel is to have something that will last, in addition I was interested in the non-reactive properties of stainless.  If I were to inject anything acidic it will dissolve the metal ions and a) throw off the flavor and b) over time it is toxic.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the product did not claim to be stainless it wouldn't be an issue.  But I bought this product based on this claim.  The product has been kept dry, treated the same as all my other metalware.  This is the only product I have that is rusting, except for my skillet which is expected its cast iron.  If anyone is interested I will post pictures of the peeling surface.\n",
      "perfect for making smoothies\n",
      "Didn't work for my purposes (using it with my hand blender) but I use them to drink big glasses of water.\n",
      "Size was misleading.  This is too large for our blender.  Other than that, it's a nice metal cup.\n",
      "Solid construction, heavy weight, and works perfectly with my Cuisinart immersible blender\n",
      "A must have accessory.  Very well made.\n",
      "Great Product\n",
      "Use them all the time for smoothies.\n",
      "fast\n",
      "E V E R Y  S I N G L E  DAY! Day in day out since we got this, he has came through and boiled our water faithfully in the morning, noon, and night. If he dies, he will get an officers burial. If you are looking for, or comparing water kettles, this is the one to buy. Not this one though, he's not for sale, he's all ours.\n",
      "gift\n",
      "I used this almost every day and it's perfect for warming up water for my tea. Quick, nice looking and sturdy. My last one was plastic on the outside and, after much use, it cracked, which is why I specifically looked for stainless steel in its replacement.\n",
      "I use this to make tea and pour-over coffee; and it works very well for that. I have never tried heating anything but water in it; Because of the narrow opening, cleaning a mess out of it would be somewhat difficult. It has a magnetic switch that cuts off the power when you lift the pot, making burning up a dry pot unlikely.\n",
      "it isn't turned off automatically when water boils up.\n",
      "a little stiff to pull. but it,s allright\n",
      "well made disassembles for easy cleaning\n",
      "Works great\n",
      "It works and is very sturdy. At the moment I've only injected wet marinades, but this is great. I do recommend it.\n",
      "I bought this to go along with my immersion blender (the blender didn't come with one). It works well and cleans up easy. It conducts cold and hot temps very well, so be careful when washing with hot soapy water! Also, I got a little lazy and didn't wash it once for a couple days (I did rinse it, though). When I got around to washing it, I found some rust-like spots on the inside. I used some Barkeeper's friend and it cleaned up fine. I don't think it's dishwasher-safe.\n",
      "As expected\n",
      "These are so awesome! You can have a very large milkshake, or other beverage. They look nice and clean easily as well.\n",
      "I love it. Brings me back to the day when milkshakes used to be served in these. Awesome. I ma not using it for milkshakes but more for a nutritious shake. I need some strong and healthy and big where I can use my new hand mixer right in the container I can drink from.\n",
      "This is the second one I purchsed! It it light and durable!\n",
      "Homemade old fashion mil shakes are the best\n",
      "I'm using this almost daily for protein smoothies.  Instructions on my stick blenderrecommend using frozen fruit but that is like chipping concrete.  I take what I want out of the freezer and throw it in this cup til l it thaws some and then dinner takes 15 seconds\n",
      "Works great.\n",
      "This is the third time I've bought the Aroma kettle. The first one was as a gift for my mother, the second was for me, and now the third is for my office.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first two were bought years ago and were of much higher quality than the latest. Both are still being used after 3-4 years of use. Mine has developed a slight leak, but I am still able to use it as long as I don't leave water in for long periods of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The newest one came in and I was a little surprised at the changes to the model. This one has a metal colinder-style behind the spout instead of the mesh protector from the older version. I'm not sure which I prefer, but both work fine. I do notice that the newer one is a lighter material (in terms of weight and strength), but I haven't experienced any adverse effects as a result.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even with the changes from the first ones I bought, I still love this model. I will probably buy another in the future. I highly recommend it.\n",
      "I use it daily, and find it fast and easy to fill and pour.  Would buy it again.\n",
      "Love them!\n",
      "excellent product.\n",
      "I'd hate to see what a dishwasher does to this. I had made some mayo with a stick mixer and left it in this to use in some recipes a few days later.  when i went to use it, it had formed a 2\"+ long crack from the rolled lip down along side of the cup.  \"New Commercial Grade Stainless Steel\" my a$$.  Junk.  Don't buy!\n",
      "Excellent quality!  Very Nice!\n",
      "Nice container, looks like the milk shake containers they used when I was a kid.  I almost did not buy this because it looks like it is constructed in two pieces.  I did not want a seam (for health reasons), but it turns out the main part of the cups is one piece.  I think they add a bottom to this for stability (so it will stand up nicely). I use this to make broccoli shakes in my RV with an old Braun hand blender.\n",
      "Perfect!\n",
      "Great size and sturdy metal for mixing drinks, beating eggs etc.\n",
      "Nice size cups, the metal is not thin and cheap. Bought extras as gifts for adult kids.\n",
      "Very satisfied with the quality. And the fact that spare gaskets are included is a plus. Haven't used it yet but I have no doubts that it will out perform the plastic one that it's replacing. Broke my own rule by buying cheap  the first time.\n",
      "My husband love to smoke stuff and bbq. He was super excited about this! Its great quality and he loves that there are 2 needles, especially the 1 with the larger holes so he knows that the bigger chunks of seasoning are getting in the meat.\n",
      "Great and easy to clean.\n",
      "must have for real cooks!\n",
      "Pro:\n",
      "1. Looks clean and polished. Great for leaving out on the counter\n",
      "2. retractable cord makes it easy to reduce clutter.\n",

      "4. Big fat handle, comfortable to hold\n",
      "\n",
      "Con:\n",
      "1. Heavy- maybe because i'm used to the small plastic kettles, but i found this to be very heavy, especially when filled all the way with water\n",
      "2. Hard to see water line- Because the water meter is under the handle, it takes a bit of semi-concentrated staring to actually see where the water line comes up to. I get that they are trying to make the side of the kettle look polished by being discreet about the water, but c'mon! Nobody wants to have to squint to see how much water they have in the pot. Or maybe i'm just picky *shrugs*\n",
      "3. Requires a lot of water just to even begin boiling. Sometimes i just want to boil enough water for 1 cup of tea. Not gonna happen, cuz this kettle requires you to fill to a minimum level to even detect water to begin boiling\n",
      "4. The lid is extremely hard to open.- This is definitely my #1 complaint, and the biggest reason i ended up returning this kettle (Thank you, Amazon return policy!) The lid will not just pop open with a button or something- you have to give the handle a good tug before it opens. Usually this would be no big deal, but if you just finished boiling water and want to add more water to boil (5th cup of tea, anyone?) it's actually very scary popping the still hot lid open, then having some of the hot water that's still inside splash out at you.\n",
      "\n",
      "When i was first shopping around for a good kettle i was debating between this and the Melitta 40994, and this won. However after a week i decided i definitely did not like this, and bought the Melitta instead.\n",
      "The Melitta fixed all the issues i did not like about this one, and i am quite happy with it so far (button to open lid, big fill line on the side of the kettle). Keep in mind that the Melitta will cost you a few extra pennies (or dollars, depending on how cheap you can find it on amazon :)\n",
      "This is really a useful product as the water gets hot so quickly.\n",
      "An amazing fast-boiler, I'm completely happy with it.\n",
      "It boils water quickly. I also have the Chef's Choice International a couple years prior which is a bit more expensive (although I bought it on sale). Compared to that, this has a metal cap which is nicer for those people who are concerned about plastic/silicone exposure to the water. Not a deal-breaker, but I do not like that the lid pops on/off. I prefer a lid that flips open.. especially right after boiling water. I prefer the Chef's Choice but this works well too.\n",
      "Just what I wanted - well made\n",
      "The pot was constructed of rather thin stainless, which was ample to prevent it from denting, but noticeably thinner than earlier models. Lasted 3 years and quit.\n",
      "It gets the job done.  It boils much faster than my previous electric kettle and is not made of plastic, which always freaked me out a bit about my last one.  I'm sure there are kettles that boil faster, but probably not for this price.  Still working strong after a year.\n",
      "Easy to use!\n",
      "I was happy with the quality for the price.  I ordered 2 and they must have been appreciated as they are gone from my house.\n",
      "This is one of the handiest  items I have bought this year.  I use it with my stick mixer to make protein drinks.  Then, I either drink directly from it, or pour the drink into a regular glass.  So glad I found it !\n",
      "I originally bought 1 for myself and have used it to drink just about everything but milkshakes from it. Family and friends liked it so I have bought more and gifted them.\n",
      "Works well for mixing my protein drink in the morning.\n",
      "Beautiful\n",
      "great to make shakes\n",
      "Its a cup, performs as advertised\n",
      "Hi.. I ordered this wonderful device, last year for gifts, having had mine, loving it.. I noticed in the model, size, I got recently for a vacation home, the volume is less or else I used bigger mugs, I had to refill and heat another pot... Not an issue, smaller cups, not giant mugs will still give me what I want, instantly almost.. I do have a gas stove at camp, but this was wonderful to just fill  put on.. thanks for asking..\n",
      "it's good but after a year the paint was getting off from inside :'\n",
      "OK\n",
      "Really helped, I had purchase a plastic one and it was a total waste, this one really got the job done, highly recommend to anyone doing a pig-roast... Excellent quality!\n",
      "It's heavy and big. Came with some extra parts that will be most useful. Packing was a higher quality neoprene foam that you would expect from a higher end product but put into a cardboard box. Mostly stainless but the finger and thumb pieces are made from cast and coated or electroplated which is really upsetting since small casted parts have a great history of breaking after some use. There is a yellow colored glue that has been used to hold the thumb ring onto the plunger which is a serious issue in my book. If Im lucky it won't slip off, if it does, if i am really lucky, i can drill and tap it for a stainless allen screw. It will last for some time to come but with those parts and issues, it may or may not last longer. Only time and use will tell. I'll try to give a update after a few month of real use. For the price, I expected more but for the price I should have expected this.\n",
      "Shoot em up.\n",
      "I have been using it for over 2 years and is still looking like the first day. Stainless steel, safe for the dishwasher. Excellent quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should fit any regular hand blender.  Perfect size to make 2 smoothies.\n",
      "These are excellent quality would recommend this to anyone who wants a great product very happy with them\n",

      "Just as pictured\n",
      "Sturdy.  Great to use with immersion blender.  Easy to clean.\n",
      "I've had this tea kettle about 2 years and use it just about every day.  Good capacity and heats quickly.\n",
      "It is stainless, and easy to use. Good one!\n",
      "I purchased this in Oct. 2009, and I've had no problems with it!  Was searching for an electric kettle for my daughter to use at college, and wanted to see if any other brands or newer models were better than mine.  After reading many reviews, I will stick with what I know to be good.  The features I like the most are the cordless pot, auto shut-off, and fast heating.\n",
      "works great but the ridge in the side made it hard to fit top glass some of mine were to big others wouldnt make a seal\n",
      "Good product\n",
      "It does what it claims to do. No frills here, just a basic tool everyone needs.  I use it for hot liquids like butter coffee.\n",
      "Very nice\n",
      "I ordered two.  They are metal and look like the ones used in cafes to make milk shakes.  They are metal.  But one of them came broken with cuts on two sides in the metal.  In all fairness I haven't contacted Amazon, because it is usable for the small protein shakes I bought it for.  I just don't understand how the metal could get cut on two sides in shipping.  This probably would not happen to anyone else.\n",
      "I use these to hold the cold water from a water cooler; they're wonderful. If you ever try to use them as a receptacle in a DIY mini-foundry, note that they will deteriorate at about 1000 degrees. :)\n",
      "Exactly what I wanted - these cups fit my stick blender perfectly.  Well made and easy to clean!\n",
      "Extremely well made, very solid. Would definitely recommend.\n",
      "Well built\n",
      "GREAT\n",
      "Quality of the product is great. As others have mentioned, the threads are fine, but I don't see that being an issue as long as you are careful when you match the top and bottom to attach.\n",
      "great\n",
      "Wife has a little trouble due to small hands otherwise well made.  The needles are big enough to let spices pass.  Very tight seal.  Helps to use a little cooking oil as a lubricant.\n",
      "Finally an injector that doesn't fly apart while in use!  I have a couple other injectors, one metal and one plastic, they broke easily.  This one is holding up quite well and I really like the straight needle to pinpoint injection instead of using the needle with multiple holes in in it.\n",
      "Have already bought five (5) of these. Just know some day I won't be able to find them again, that's the way it usually works. You go from zero to water hot enough for instant coffee in about 2/min. What's not to love.\n",
      "Use this kettle daily. Fast hot water with no fuss or bother. No worries if you forget it because of the automatic shut off. Burnt dozens of kettles before getting this.\n",
      "We use it multiple times per day. The only complaint we have is that if you only have 500ml or so in it, the sensor takes a long time to figure out that it is boiling. Sometimes it boils for 30-45 seconds before turning off which puts a lot of steam into the air and under the cabinets.\n",
      "Good tea pot. Cold water goes in. Hot water comes out. Magic.\n",
      "I bought these as gifts, and have one myself I use with my Cuisinart Smart Stick for smoothies.\n",
      "good for Kitchen aid immersion.\n",
      "These cups are sturdy and are perfect for use with my immersion blender. They fit the blades of the blender perfectly giving me the frothiest BPC I've ever had. They are an excellent replacement to the original blender carafe. They also work great for smoothies and shakes.\n",

      "Works Great, Received 2 extra O-Rings for each Needle and Plunger.  Only problem I had was screwing plunger back on after cleaning, there is a trick to it. Screw on cap before pushing plunger into cylinder, little tricky, but have no trouble now with experience.\n",

      "I like this kettle because it does just what it says it will and it does it fast. I don't really like the plastic interior hinged lid, but the one model kettle I found that had a completely separate metal lid was not as convenient to fill because the lid is right under the handle.  The fill gauge on this model is a little hard to see, but it's not bad.  Overall, I'd recommend it.\n",

      "I bought mine at least two years ago for my weekend house. I bought it after I nearly burned down my house with one of those that plug in brands that doesn't turn off automatically - and had to drive back to my house after an hour with the slight recollection that I \"may\" have left it plugged in. Well that did it (since it was coal level hot). I bought an Aroma and never regretted it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I use it every weekend. I never cleaned out the inside because I never saw a blemish on the inside (I use spring water in it). It heats the water quickly turns off every time when the water boils. The outside looks like new. I just ordered another one for my office. I'll post again on my experience when the new one arrives.\n",
      "The kettle heats water at an okay speed.  Unfortunately, it seems to have some leakage around the handle and at the base where the stainless meets the plastic.  I wouldn't buy it again.  It will need to be replaced fairly soon.\n",
      "This kettle is just average to poor. I'd give it two stars because it works but the reviews just seemed way to complementary. The plastic and metal feel thin and cheap. The lid requires some force to open that makes it feel like you are going to break it. On top of that, after you heat it up, the outside of the kettle is piping hot.\n",
      "\n",
      "I used another model at another job and it just felt and sounded so nice. From the nice \"ding\" when the water boiled to the insulated quality of the kettle. I did not get that one because the autostop worked on it but I'd rather than than this piece of junk.\n",
      "I have been using this kettle for four years now since I bought it on Amazon in 2014, for the same price. It had worked perfectly for 4380 times (365 days*4 years*3 times a day)!! The automatic shut off stopped working from last month which keeps water from boiling and turning to steam, so I have to lift it up from the base manually. It's time for me to retire it and buy a new one! But with its hardworking for the past 4 years, what can I complain about? Thank you for your service Aroma Kettle!\n",
      "does not automatically shut of when hot water is poured.\n",
      "Very good. Specially because I do not see the heating rod inside. Easy to use and wash.\n",

      "great\n",
      "I have used this several times since purchase and have not noticed the metal corroding.  I suspect that previous reports of corrosion are by people who left the needle in the brine for too long.  It works well, the primary needle is a standard injection shape and works great.  The secondary needle has a series of holes on the sides, unless you force the liquid through quickly (which it recommends you don't do), liquid only comes out of the bottom holes.  Other than that it seems to work as advertised!  I noted that it has no way to measure how much you have pulled into the needle or injected into something.  The drawback with a solid metal unit is that you cannot see if you have a bubble inside and there is no way to check your current level.  I fixed this by scratching onto the plunger stem the measurements in ml for regular intervals.  This helped greatly, but again without a way to check how much air is inside it is not as accurate as it could be.\n",

      "I love these cups!  I bought them because I'm a little scared about drinking out of plastic (and putting it in the dishwasher) all the time.  These cups are very high in quality - nice thick metal and hold a large quantity of liquid.  I like making my protein shakes in the blender, and then drinking them out of these cups with a straw.  They are also good for holding a large quantity of ice water, so that I don't have to run from my desk to get more water as often during the day.  I expect these to last for years to come, and I like that they keep me from using as many disposable water bottles in the long run.  I've had these for several months and they still look like new - I highly recommend these cups!\n",
      "Perfect for extra mixing cups for making malts\n",
      "Perfect for my morning protein shake.  Since its metal it transfers the cold to your hand very efficiently, but just use a foam sleeve with it and you're good to go.\n",
      "Purchased an immersion blender. It came with a plastic blending cup. It was nice, but, this one is so much better. Blending smoothies and whipping cream is so much faster in this as the material helps keep everything colder. And the capacity is greater.....I can blend more eggs for omelets, make two smoothies instead of one, etc...\n",
      "I've had this thing for several years and it's fast and it works!  The water tastes fine. There is a little bit of rusty color on the bottom of the inside but it doesn't affect the water.  I think it's great.\n",
      "If you just want to heat water for a cup of tea or a cup of hot chocolate or whatever, this is the appliance for you.  I went to Germany for a vacation to visit my son and daughter-in-law and she had one that she used every morning.  So as soon as I got home, I ordered one and I just love it.  I have used it almost daily.\n",
      "I've never had any problems with this pot. The on/off switch is secure and works great, and the water boils very quickly. It's even a bit sylish sitting on my countertop. My recommendation would be: go for it!\n",
      "This thing is great for the occasional cup of tea.  It's simple, safe, and very fast, with very good ergonomics.  My on complain/comment is that the plug and cord get a bit warm during use.  It seems like they should have used a heavier gauge wire.\n",
      "I researched and agonized for months because I wanted something with minimum amount of plastic (so stainless or ceramic were my main options) and something that doesn't rust as thoroughly and easily as my old Breville did. Maybe it's the quality of the LA metro area water (three different family members don't have as many issues with stainless steel kettles in Georgia). But I'm about ready to give up on finding one that works. I knew Aroma is a cheaper brand but the reviews were so high that I went for it. It's sad that it went bad so quickly. At least the Breville took months to accumulate the gunk. I did try vinegar with very little success. I boiled it repeatedly and scrubbed.\n",

I will note, my injection is generally a water like consistency, not think like a gravy, so the size of the needle does make control a little harder.  It's packaged well, and comes apart pretty easy.  I do have a complaint about the amount of pressure required to move the plunger inside the reservoir and that is why it's rated 4 stars.\n",
      "works fantastic tool.\n",
      "If you like to grill and smoke food, an injector is a must. Chicken, brisket, and other meats are juicier and more tender when liquid is injected before cooking. When I make chicken, I inject chicken broth into the breasts. It makes an amazing difference. I use apple juice with pork shoulder, and beef broth with brisket.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bayou Classic is a high quality metal injector. It has two needle: one has a few openings and the other an opening in the tip. After experimenting, I use the needle with the single hole. It gives me better control. The piston in this injector fits very tightly. I \"lube\" it with a little of the broth or juice I am injecting before inserting it in the tube. It doesn't work well if dry. I like the stainless steel construction. I have been known to drop it now and then with greasy hands. It's heavy duty and works like a charm. I love it.\n",

Outside does get hot since it's stainless steel so watch out with little ones in the house.  After saying that I have 4 little ones and never had a problem. Just use common sense and don't leave it where they can reach it.  I have had mine for about 4 years than I moved and the movers dropped it and it wouldn't work anymore.  I was happy to replace it on Amazon.\n",
      "We really use this constantly and it works great. Very fast which I like. This is my second kettle within a year. My teenage son destroyed the first one, by putting the kettle on the stove when asked to turn kettle on. Price about doubled within a year, but it works well, so I went for it.\n",
      "I bought this as warehouse deal. Obviously it was not a good unit. I thought they would have checked it before mailing it to me. First time i used it, rusted water came pouring out from underneath the can. Nasty! I returned it for a refund. I bought something else instead.\n",

We have a newborn and use this this constantly. Make tea and for the next couple hours have hot/warm water to make formula. The only drawback is when it heats it can be a bit loud.

This is NOT the cup's fault of course, but if this is how you came to look at this time, it will not fit the bill.  The cup is also not heavy enough to hold the blender up if you try to leave it standing.

      "This injector is just plain awesome. I can't get over how heavy duty this injector is, and just how well it works. It's easy to fill, just stick the syringe in your seasoning liquid and pull up on the handle. To clean, the top screws off and only takes about a minute to wash. This is great for larger cuts of meat such as pork butt/shoulder, and injects with a lot of force. You will not have to worry about the syringe bending because of how well its made. It comes with to types of screw on syringes, so if you want to change them out, just unscrew them and screw on the other. This injector is a bit bigger than most, so smaller meats may be a challenge, but should still work great for you. The pork butt/ pulled pork that I just made came out better than it ever has because of this tool, and will definitely be using it for many years to come.\n",
      "I bought this electric kettle 5 years ago when I rented a studio apartment that had no kitchen, so I could make coffee in my french press.  I have used it every single day since then without the slightest problem.  It is fast and extremely convenient.  I still use it every day even though I now have a kitchen.  I chose this model because it has almost NO little plastic in the part that holds the water (just a small plastic filter in the pour spout and a tiny rubber grommit, everything else is stainless steel); there is just something I don't like about boiling water in a plastic container.  My two, very minor, complaints about it are: there is a small filter in the spout and it's sometimes hard to tell if I have it in place correctly, so it can come out when I pour out the hot water...but, once you have it in place correctly, it's fine.  The other is that the way it's built, it's hard to get my hand inside to really clean the bottom of the kettle, so after 5 years of daily use it has a slight buildup on the bottom from the minerals in the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, for as much as I have used it, it has really held up.  I've given the same model to people as gifts, and they love it too.  When this eventually wears out, I will replace it with the same model--but I don't see that happening anytime soon!\n",
      "The top cap was broken when I first opened it. However, I don't want to return it because I will just use it for a couple of months. Don't buy.\n",
      "I bought this teakettle on May 10, 2010. It's now April 18, 2014 and I am looking for a replacement. So this lasted about four years for me with daily use. It boils water like a charm, and I didn't have any issues with it until two years later when the spout filter disintegrated like some other reviewers experienced. It didn't bother me that much so I just used it without the filter. I really like that it is all stainless steel inside except that for the small amount of plastic that makes up the water level indicator near handle and the filter holder inside the spout. At about 3 1/2 years the switch started giving me problems. It would switch down and stay there but the light didn't go on and it failed to catch the internal mechanism that turns the kettle on. I would have to try multiple times to get it to work though it finally did, lighting up and boiling water like it was supposed to. However, now the automatic switch off has stopped working, or rather it does but the switch stays down when the light goes off, and I'm not sure if this is entirely safe or if it's just goading me into a false sense of security before turning on again. So now four years later technically this thing still boils water (used it to make coffee and tea today so far), but I'm looking for a replacement because of the switch issue. It behaved well enough that I'm looking to get another Aroma kettle (only this time in red http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ATX6HB4/ref=ox_sc_sfl_title_7?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER).\n",

I was a little concerned about some early reviews mentioning high failure rates of the silicone o-rings and difficulty finding replacements. Not only the replacements are readily available (see other reviews), as of July 2015 this item comes with spare parts. The box contained a bag with 2 (two!) replacements for each of the o-rings.\n",
      "Works like a charm!\n",
      "Nice item.  Needs more rubber washers.  They go bad quickly and I can't find them listed.\n",
      "Nice product wish the needle was a little smaller.\n",
      "My sister said she had no idea HOW much she wanted this until she had one.  She loves that she can quickly have hot tea, or anything else anytime.\n",
      "Quick easy cheap no brainer, No need for an expensive maker, this product is great. I used it for over a year no problems\n",
      "Great\n",
      "Can't wait to use them with my new hand blender!\n",
      "good product\n",
      "Restaurant quality item.\n",

      "WORKS WITH SEEDS\n",
      "Solid construction, well packaged, an overall high quality product.\n",
      "Well made and comes with extra o-rings, what more could you want?\n",
      "Works great like the case it comes in keeps everything together!\n",
      "great addition to your kitchen.\n",
      "works as advertised\n",
      "Good quality and fun...\n",
      "Great product for what I use this for: As a handmade soaper, I need SS items that are not \"cheaply\" made. This has held up, not discolored.\n",
      "works excellent with immersion blender.  easy to clean\n",
      "I chose this rating because this model can burn your fingers when you try to open the lid when it is done boiling because you can't always pry it open and you stand there trying to open it to pour more water in and the steam burns you. This new version no longer has the easy release top that used to pop up.  I purchased this water kettle because my old Aroma finally gave out and I just loved it for so many years. Unfortunately, this new model's design was significantly diminished--lighter base so it shifts around on your counter and doesn't \"plant\" itself; cord no longer wraps underneath very easily to minimize excess cord on your counter; the pot is lighter weight overall and doesn't feel sturdy; and the top is very thin with a wimpy, plastic clamp on it that sticks half the time. The top feels like it will wear out and break soon.  I was so disappointed that the new materials used for this Aroma model now are not durable and reliable anymore. I will have to look for another brand now. I wish whoever manufacturers this would take greater pride in workmanship which would improve its sales and help people in their kitchen.\n",
      "There is a fine plastic mesh \"Filter\" in the pour spout. The purpose of the filter is to create sufficient steam pressure inside the kettle when the water is boiling to force some steam through a tube to the thermostat switch to turn off the power. The mesh disintegrates after a year or so. No mesh = no steam pressure = no switching off. My house has not burned down, yet. There is probably a second safety thermostat to stop a boiled dry meltdown.\n",
      "\n",
      "Replacement meshes are available, 2 for $5 delivered from Aroma Inc.\n",
      "\n",
      "If they had only used a durable stainless steel mesh I would have given the kettle 5 stars.\n",
      "I bought this to make our Canadian bacon. It works great.\n",
      "Cheers,\n",
      "Well made product at a bargain.\n",
      "works excellent\n",
      "AAAA++++\n",
      "Love this it comes with 2 needles for smoother or slightly chunky marinades to be injected. I did a roast pork butt with Mojo and it worked great!\n",
      "This is a high-quality, well-made piece of equipment. My only regret is that they do not give the option of thinner needles for working with smaller bids and cuts of meat.\n",
      "good yes\n",
      "Nice mixer cup. Bought it to use with my mixing stick. Just right. Seems well made. Nice looking, that's for sure. Cant beat shiny! Plan on buying more for a whole set to use as drink cups as well. Fit and finish is very good. Nice solid feel in your hand. Finger print monster of course. If you have little hands around the house, this would look bad really fast, not to mention a scratch and dent attractor as well. Nice smooth rim that's got a very smooth rolled lip. Cant go wrong with these at this price. Update to review. After using this mixer cup it has now started to rust and pit. True stainless won't do that. If it is stainless, its a very low grade. Still a nice cup, but, as long as you know your getting what you paid for.\n",
      "Functional, attractive. A good buy.\n",
      "good\n",

      "Good quality, solid construction. Holds a generous amount for up to 5 lb hams, etc.\n",
      "good product, it does the job\n",
      "Great injector for meat.  I smoke a lot of meat in the summer and use this on my pork shoulder to inject marinade into.  I add a little spice to my marinade and this needle is large enough so it does not clog (think oregano).  It's made very well and I ended up purchasing one for a pal who has a smoker too.  Overall great!\n",
      "Have been having it for about half a year and it functions really well. Boil water in a short period of time.\n",
      "Stainless steel\n",

      "Nice quality cup.\n",
      "Perfect to use with my Cuisinart Stick Blender!\n",
      "Great, reminds me of the soda fountains of yesteryear.\n",
      "The base is too small to allow a stick blender to hit the bottom.\n",
      "As described and expected...used to mix bulletproof coffee with a handblender and chosen over the glass carafe for durability. The only downside is the stainless transfers heat and becomes extremely hot to the touch, and requires a mit or towel to hold the cup and pour the hot liquid mixture into another mug.\n",
      "This is a great mixing cup.  It's sturdy and seems to be of good quality.  I use my Cuisinart Smart Stick in it to make smoothies and it's wonderful!\n",
      "It can be difficult to \"pull back\" the handle to siphon up the juice, etc., but it does a nice job of injecting and cleans up easily.  It will be durable.\n",
      "use it all the time\n",
      "Good quality product.  Worked as intended.\n",
      "Perfect quality for me.\n",
      "great\n",
      "I purchased this injector along with the roast rack from another company.  I have used product less than 4 times and it is no longer holding or having any suction from the injector needle.  It has stripped out after only 4 times and using hand tightening.  Very unhappy with this product and going to attempt a return/replacement.  :: I am crossing my fingers :: Not happy as I was trying to cook a 4 pound chicken today and wasted most of my marinade as it leaked...\n",
      "\n",
      "It looks good on paper but does not hold up.\n",
      "great\n",
      "Gets the marinate inside and out. Works great!  Wonderful addition to our grilling tool kit!\n",
      "After reading all of the other reviews, I bought this one. Quickly Heats up, easy open cap, and handle great. Excellent price especially compared to others. This is a staple in our house and we normally purchase one ever 3-5 years. Hoping this will last that long!\n",
      "This handy pot get my water hot fast!\n",
      "I would say 3-4 times faster than my old stove kettle.\n",
      "I will be drinking more hot water from now on.\n",
      "Bought this for a friend during Christmas and I end up using it as his house every time I visit.  I am constantly making tea or hot chocolate and this is so fast, neat and perfect to have on the counter.\n",
      "flaw one - nearly impossible to see the water level (you have to look behind the handle and you may just find it) and flaw two - you kind of have to figure out where to put the carafe down on the little disc\n",
      "\n",
      "so looking forward to the upgrades (memo to industrial designers)\n",
      "\n",
      "Otherwise, very nice looking - and fast on the draw\n",
      "I got one of these about three years ago and I love it.  My daughter in law used it over the holidays to prepare water for baby formula and thought the speed was wonderful. She thought she would like one for Christmas so I ordered it for her.  I was disappointed in the construction- it's not near as nice as my original Aroma, but the bigger problem was that several times it did not automatically shut off and boiled all the water out.  It also leaked.  I returned the first one and got a replacement, but while visiting I noticed that again it did not always shut off after it started boiling.  I realize that you should always  watch appliances while in use, but after never having to worry about my own Aroma, it is very disturbing to see this one in action.  Bring back the old production, please!\n",
      "considering how much it cost and the basic function of boling water in my office quickly for coffee, there aren't any negatives really. no bells and whistles, just boils water.\n",
      "Lovely, and exactly like the ones you see in diners, at the milkshake machine. Gives an authentic feel to shakes I make at home, and matches my stainless steel decor. Nice for the price.\n",
      "Great product.\n",
      "Just like the ones in the old malt shop.\n",
      "love it\n",
      "We have a vintage 3-spindle Hamilton Beech Milkshake Maker, but only had 1 cup.  The cups are very specific that fit this milkshake maker.  They have to have a lip on the bottom of the cup so that the machine can hold the cup in place during mixing.  These cups were a great price and looked to be exactly what we needed.  When they arrived, they weren't the perfect fit, but we've kept them and used them numerous times.  The lip on the bottom of the cup is not exactly the right fit, so sometimes the cup will slip during mixing operations.  We just make sure to hold the cup in place to avoid massive milk clean-ups.  They've worked otherwise and we continue to use them.\n",
      "It's a metal cup. Not too much to say. Good price.\n",
      "Very well made injector.  You would really need to use this as a hammer or something for it not to last a lifetime.  The O-rings are the only thing that will need replacing and they include some extras in the box.  Great product!!\n",
      "Quality built product. Should last for many tears.\n",
      "It works well and u t comes with extra  rings but a little hard to push down\n",
      "Works well and scares people too\n",
      "I had one made by ge lasted like 8 years this is the second one I bought both took a crap within a month don't waste your money or time im going back to my grandma tea pot to heat water\n",
      "Got them as gift to give away. I don't know if it functions ok but I served it's intended purpose. I did not get it back so it must be okay product\n",
      "This could be the best water kettle I have ever used! I was wondering if the quality was good when I received it coz the water kettle was a kind of light, but when I used it later, it looked great! I have been using it for a few months and it always works very well, bring the water to boil only for a few minutes. Love it!\n",
      "i love this water boiler , its lightening fast .its pretty  handy , get this you will like it  a lot\n",
      "great mixing cup, and cup for cold water on hot days to keep the hands cool.\n",
      "Rusted after the first use.  Was hand washed and dried.\n",
      "High quality will serve its purpose.  Just don't expect to use it with as a bar tin, almost too heavy for that purpose can't really seal a pint glass inside of it.\n",
      "Good purchase\n",
      "looks very sturdy - haven't used yet\n",
      "I like this marinade syringe.  My hope is that it will last.  My concern is the rubber ring washer which enables the pressure to be maintained.  This may be weak point as it has been in others.  Finding a new and snugly fitting rubber ring is just about impossible.  But, I do hope this one lasts.  I remind everyone...make sure you hand wash every component you use, by taking it all apart and washing and rinsing carefully and allowing to fully air dry before putting it way in a sealed bag or container to be ready for the next use.  We usually brine but for those times you do not have a day up to a week to brine, just inject everywhere you can in the meat and allow it to sit awhile so the brine can spread out in the meat and smoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bon Appetit!\n",
      "Supper Product A*****\n",
      "We bought this after breaking several others that were glass or plastic. I'm very glad we spent the money and got this one. The two injector needles allows us to have variation in chunky v. non-chunky mixes. It is very easy to use with injection being smooth and non-jarring. It is also very easy to clean, and I don't have concerns about getting all of the junk out since it one piece.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update 2 years later: This thing is still working great. Definitely worth the cost.\n",
      "very nice\n",
      "If you like cooking think pieces of pork or beef, this is the right tool to have\n",
      "I use it quite frequently.\n",
      "Just beware to avoid blocking the needle with pieces of meat or spices\n",
      "Good brand. My first purchase of same brand lasted good for two years then started taking longer and longer to heat water\n",
      "Good cup but be aware it won't fit on the hooks of a Hamilton Beach 700 series \"Classic\" milkshake blender.  It is too tall.  That's the only reason it's not 5 stars.\n",
      "Perfect with my KitchenAid KHB2351CU 3-Speed Hand Blender\n",
      "Great value.\n",
      "This item is a great quality and price. It was recommended with the All-Clad K2750DGT Stainless Steel Immersion hand blender, but this cup is barely wide enough at the bottom to fit this particular blender. I would suggest a cup with a larger base in this situation. This is. Good cup overall.\n",
      "Perfect for mixing and drinking my protein shakes. Great size! Great weight, and dishwasher safe. I need to get a few more ;)\n",
      "fine\n",
      "This injector is super heavy duty and works perfectly.  The choice of two needles is nice to have, too. It's also very easy to clean.\n",
      "They do a great job.\n",
      "AHhhh! Herr Doktor! Zee injection izz ready for zee bird.\n",
      "You have to be real careful when injecting meat so as not to spray the marinade all over yourself.\n",
      "great cup\n",
      "The only downside is I need to get a couple longer spoons to help get all the smoothie goodness out after blending it up!\n",
      "Got these to replace the cheap plastic ones that came with our stick-type blender which we use to make smoothies, etc.  These work great and are very reasonably priced.\n",
      "Great cup but the bottom is too small for the Breville immersion blender to reach the bottom.\n",
      "I use mine about six times a day - we are serious coffee and tea people - and its still going strong and doing what it does. I love a good appliance, and this certainly is a good appliance.\n",
      "I guess the fact that we killed one of these in three years is bad, but we use it CONSTANTLY. The price is reasonable, and it works well and fast. We liked it enough we bought the same kind here on Amazon to replace our old one (previous one we bought at Target, I think.)\n",
      "Soooo, get the one that is cheapest.  This one is a replacement for a Toastless that I purchased in 2011.  The temperature cut off failed after two years and investigation said that they ALL fail for the same reason.  This one was much cheaper and the quality is excellent.  I am sure in two years I will be replacing it also but, in the mean time, it works GREAT!\n",
      "This seemed to be the best price for a decent, stainless steel electric kettle. It gets the water hot fast, and it's nice and streamlined- easy to clean. The design seems modern enough, yet classy- a perfect fit for our kitchen.\n",
      "If you really love having a whistle, you'll miss out with this model. It brings the water to a boil, then shuts off. It's up to you to remember you were fixing tea! But at least it won't burn the house down if you forget.\n",
      "The six-cup quantity seems good for most purposes. It boils water fast enough that, if you need more than that, you could have another pot ready pretty quickly.\n",
      "I love mine!\n",
      "As discribed\n",
      "This was very easy to use and worked like a charm. I got all kinds of compliments on my bird!\n",

      "Nice product\n",
      "Ive had this cup for over a year and I use it everyday. It is a great quality product. Easy to clean. Holds a wopping 30 oz. I just love it and highly recommend. I use it for smoothies.\n",
      "It is top draw\n",
      "Doesnt fit my machine\n",
      "good purchase\n",
      "So this would be great for anything other than what I used it for. I used it for soap making. It is stainless steel, however the Lye ate through the bottom That is glued on. It is NOT ONE Solid piece.\n",
      "We used this kettle for about 3 months, when it started to leak, leaving a puddle if left with water.\n",
      "I have been enjoying this kettle as it quickly and quietly heats up water for my tea.  The heating process is started by simply pressing on a lever.  I appreciate  the fact that it will turn itself off once the water has been heated to the proper temperature.  The base on which it stands on is sturdy.  The only criticism I have is that the water level gauge on the kettle is obscured by the handle and is difficult to very see when I am filling the kettle with water.  Thus I have to guesstimate the level of the water by timing how long I have been using the faucet.  Afterwards, I check the gauge itself to make sure that I have not exceeded the max level.  If the gauge had a small red indicator ball which floats at the top of the water level, it would be much easier to read the gauge.  Otherwise, this is a good product.\n",
      "I love tea and had been using a stove-top kettle purchased at Wal-Mart for heating water.  I love this new gadget!  It heats water up FAST.  I love the cordless function.  I already purchased another one to use in my classroom and also plan on buying one for my tea-lover friend's birthday!\n",
      "I have 3 of these kettles. Two of them work really well and the third won't shut itself off. This is the reason I have 3, I needed to replace the broken one (which broke after over a year of regular use - heating water at least 3 times a day). One of the two non-broken one no longer lights up when on. Still, I really like this kettle, it is a good size and very convenient.\n",
      "Very well made.  Heavy and well machined.  Extra seals in the kit along with fitted foam case\n",

      "Really tough to push just straight liquid.\n",
      "A very nice injector at a very reasonable price.\n",
      "Worked once. Then wouldn't work for injecting. Even replaced o ring. Still wouldn't plunge right.\n",
      "Nice basting set.\n",
      "I was supposed to make milkshakes in this, but instead I put dirty cutlery in it next to the sink to let it soak! ;)) tee hee hee! Don't tell!\n",
      "Perfect for using with my stick blender.\n",
      "love them easy to clean\n",
      "Great product works as it should will buy again\n",
      "Great product! Works well with my immersion blender!\n",
      "Single smoothie or other mixtures that fits the 200 watt immersion blender.\n",
      "Perfect partner with the Cuisinart Stick Mixer. Cleans up quickly and\n",
      "I use this kettle everyday, I broke the lid but it still works. I got a replacement and decided to just keep using it til it actually stops working. I make tea and coffee and other things with it 5-9 times a day!\n",
      "This thing rocks, its the gold standard for heating water, if I want to make pasta or rice or do anything with boiling water I use the kettle to boil the water, and then pass to the pan.  It's super fast.\n",
      "This was a gift to my aunt 2 years ago and she loves it.\n",
      "She was still raving about it this year and told me she uses it ALL THE TIME.\n",
      "It's great that she can heat the water and then take the carafe with her to the table.\n",
      "Worked perfect!  Even comes with an extra set of O-rings. Thanks.\n",
      "Has proved that cooking can be a more pleasurable experience means juicier food. Enjoy this product.\n",
      "Works great and seems to be well made and sturdy.\n",
      "Works very well,a must for cooking pulled pork!\n",
      "Just as described. Good for Turkey and other roasting projects.\n",
      "Best injector on the market.  I use this a few times a month and have thrown my other injectors out.  Built to last, easy to use and helps keep the mess down.  The the versatility of the two tips can truly change how you prepare cuts of meat and the flavors you can introduce to all levels of the meat.\n",
      "It accommodates the muzzle of a smaller hand blender, but doesn't accommodate the muzzle of the miallegro very well (which is a more powerful blender).  I'll probably need to get a different brand for the family \"girls\", but I mean to get them the more powerful hand blenders, which probably have wider muzzles also.\n",

      "Very handy to own in the kitchen! Reasonably priced\n",
      "I use the kettle all the time!  Water is really hot and perfect for seeping tea. Also great for making rice and pastas. Just boil water and pour on top of your product.\n",
      "There are less expensive options, however, the overall design is a pleasure to own and display in my kitchen. Love it!\n",
      "There are so many uses for this kettle.  It heats fast and turns off automatically.  Love it and use it daily.\n",
      "really nice, threw away infuser that I got with pre-made marinade and used this one. worked like a charm and was easy to clean afterword's\n",
      "Far better than the plastic meat syringe, the stainless steel is sturdy and easier to clean. It also comes with extra gaskets for the syring tube and two types of syringe needles - one with holes for chunky marination juice. Highly recommend for those who roast or smoke meats.\n",
      "Ugh. Needle filled with meat product. Never got clean. I'm a chef....BIG no!\n",

      "I have never had an electric kettle that has lasted for over 1 year until this one, that is why I never spend a bundle on one.  My Aroma kettle just went out 4.25 years later.  For an electric kettle, I feel that this is excellent performance, so I am on Amazon today to purchase another.  The heating element is covered so hard water deposits are not a big issue with this kettle.  I just use vinegar to rinse out the residue every few months.  At the current price and longevity it cost me $0.55 a month.  That is a deal.\n",

      "Edited to add: and here's the but...\". Apparently that Max fill line is a fiction. If I fill the kettle to that line or close, it will leak. It leaks out from the switch, which is rather alarming, but as that might be where the overfill drain exits??? I tested it again with only 4 cups, and all worked fine with no overflow.  Keeping the box in case the situation worsens, but also keeping in mind that this is not usable as a 1.5 liter kettle.\n",

      "As long as you don't need a very wide opening at the top, this thing is virtually impossible to find a flaw in. Perhaps the cord could be longer. Perhaps the sides could NOT get scorching hot when it's in use. Perhaps I could fly to the moon on the back of my dog. None of those things would REALLY make this better - it does it's job, it does it very well, and it looks mighty fine doing it.\n",
      "I love the look. It is very easy to use and clean. The only problem is the plastic material used at the outlet--at high temperature, the plastic will release toxical chemical?\n",
      "Great mixer cups.  Heavy, quality construction, and well polished.  Just like the more expensive cup that came with my mixer these are one seamless cup with a ridged base piece welded over the bottom so it \"hooks\" onto the mixer cup holders.  These work on my waring commercial mixer.\n",
      "Great to make milkshakes in\n",
      "Purchased to use with my Cuisinart to make smoothies and shakes.  Perfect for making these. Reminds me of the old fashioned malt shop containers.  Easy to clean, just pop into dishwasher.\n",
      "good quality heavy-duty for my restaurant\n",
      "Reminds me of the old days at the drugstore counter.  A really nice and well  made cup for smoothies or shakes. Easy to clean too. I'm sure it's psychological  but smoothies taste better in this cup too.\n",
      "nice size an sturdy\n",
      "Love this cup, perfect for my smoothies!\n",
      "This works great.  Able to use all different kinds of liquids with this.  Really nice how it all comes apart and can be cleaned without much trouble.\n",
      "This has worked well for a variety of experiments.  The needles pierce flesh well and are easy to wash.\n",
      "NICE QUALITY\n",

      "another must have\n",
      "Replacement for plastic one. This is much better.\n",
      "And still going strong.  Amazon says, \"You purchased this item on November 01, 2010\" when I came to this page to order another one of these kettles as a present.  So, the least I can do is give it some stars as it's performed extraordinarily well.\n",

      "I make French press coffee every morning and this is how I heat the water.  Fast and neat, this kettle has a permanent place on my countertop.\n",
      "Did not like it,  did not like it! It makes the water taste funny. Nothing worse than going through the strokes of grinding your best coffee, heating the water, doing the French press thing and the coffee taste like you know what. It didn't take us long to send this piece of brown matter back. Do not buy this!\n",
      "New kettle from Dec 2013:\n",
      "I bought one of these 3 years ago and it worked great, until a relative had a brain fart moment and forgot that it was an ELECTRIC kettle, put it on the gas stove, and promptly destroyed it. This had been one of my favorite kitchen tools, so when I saw the same model (according to Amazon) happen to go on Lightning Sale a few days later, I bought it again. I've just unpacked it, and noticed the design has been updated.\n",
      "1. The pull ring on top for opening the lid is a little squared off, it used to be round. No practical effect, but an easy way to see what version you're dealing with from the outside.\n",
      "2. The lid is now spring loaded so it stays up on its own, but stops short of fully vertical. The old lid opened further, a little past vertical, so it was a little easier to position under the water dispenser spout filling, but you couldn't let the lid tilt forward at all or it would fall shut. You gain a little, you lose a little.\n",
      "3. The plastic frame and filter screen that used to fill the spout are now completely gone. It's just holes in the stainless steel wall that lead to the the stainless steel spout. This is nice, you don't have to pour water through plastic anymore. Also, the old plastic frame used to hold back several dribbles of water when you tried to empty it, so you had to shake it to get rid of as much of the last drops as you could if you wanted to let it air dry. This new design drains more completely. So double win here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lid is still plastic on the inside, and there's some plastic on the inner chamber near the lid's hinge, but both are well above the maximum water line and don't touch the water. There's still a small pass through to the water level indicator, both still seem to be plastic, but like the original, only a little water seems to go inside. I've boiled and tossed a few kettles full of water, the first pot with a little vinegar, and was bummed to find a crescent of small, dense water spots or burn discoloration form around the inner bottom of the kettle. Some other reviewers said it doesn't seem to affect the function, so oh well. Drank my first cup, and it tastes fine. So this'll be a keeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "My first kettle from Nov 2010:\n",
      "I loved that this was mostly stainless steel, cuz I didn't want a plasticky taste, and if plastic is going to leach any chemicals/plasticizers (whether you taste it or not), it'll do it much more when hot. Over the course of 3 years, the inside was still nice and shiny, that was awesome. And the inside is pretty smooth. The hidden heating coil is never in contact with the water, I think it's more like a double boiler design. So the water chamber is pretty smooth, and you never have to worry about a coil getting in the way of cleaning, or having to clean a crazy shaped coil. There was a plastic frame in the spout that held a plastic filter screen. I don't think it contacted the water while boiling, but it did contact the water as you poured through it. The inner part of the lid is also plastic, but it's above the water line. Also, I think the water level indicator may be plastic but it looks like only a little water goes in. I never noticed any funny tastes, so I was happy. I even used it to boil water for cooking instead of boiling in the pot on the stove because it seems faster.\n",
      "\n",
      "We used to use a hot water dispenser. They suck a lot of electricity over the course of a day to keep that water hot, but are super convenient if you need hot water often. We didn't, so the water would sit and the taste would become a little \"off\", like stale or flat, and we stopped using it. We used the microwave for awhile, but cups get too hot to hold, you have to guess the time, and it's not convenient for more than a glass of water at once. This electric kettle is fast, stops when it reaches boil, and you can tell pretty easily when it'd done by the boiling sound and the click of the switch turning itself off. A definite quality of life improvement.\n",
      "Works great, did 2 turkeys, no problem with clogging. Fast shiping\n",
      "Easy to use and now I can make my cooking just like the Chefs do it.\n",
      "Love this thing. Comes in a larger size and I am glad I did not get it. I can't see how the larger one would fit my hand with the plunger fully extended. This is a piece of hardware. My days of breaking the plastic ones are over.\n",
      "great product\n",
      "Convenient.\n",
      "Very well made, but would be better if it came with a set of smaller needles for chicken.\n",
      "this makes is so much easier\n",
      "Too hard to pull the handle.\n",
      "Perfect for making smoothies with my immersion blender.\n",
      "works well and super fun for kids.\n",
      "This stainless cup is the best companion to use with my immersion blender to make smoothies or shakes.  I fill up with fresh fruit and keep in fridge overnight, so everything is nice and cold, then in the morning, just add some yogurt, almond milk, etc.  The cup is very durable and stands up well to the blender and dishwasher (much better than the plastic cup that came with the immersion blender!).  Totally worth it.\n",
      "Everything as expected.\n",
      "I love this for mixing up my bulletproof coffee!\n",
      "to big for the Hamilton beach729 mixer\n",
      "Bought this water kettle over 2 years ago from Amazon and decided now to write a review..lol...This is working as great as it did from the first day I got it...Never had any problems at all..It is one of the best investments I have ever made in a small kitchen appliance..I clean up the built up lime scale, etc..., with about 1/4 cup of plain old vinegar and about 3 cups of water once a week and, voila..it comes out sparklling clean..who needs a fancy expensive Coffee Pot..instant coffee, a cup of tea, hot chocolate... what more do you need..Highly recommended..\n",
      "I have been using this kettle almost daily for several years now.. and have loved it since day one.. it is easy to keep clean and heats the water quickly.\n",
      "Update: finally bit the dust after 7 years of almost daily use.  I will be buying another one.\n",
      "I've had this for 3 years now and never any problems with it.  Works perfectly and heats up water super, super fast!!  I've seen one with a glass carafe instead of metal (at walmart) and might try that one as well.  For the money this performs great and I wouldn't hesitate to get it again if it ever stops working.  So far so good though :-)\n",
      "We have purchased a few of these.  Each has lasted a few years in our semi-British household where they get a pretty rigorous daily workout.\n",
      "I use this kettle every day for my french press coffee. Works like a charm and heats up water very quickly. I did not need such a large kettle however. I use about 400g of water (go Metric system!) and that doesn't even reach the minimum fill level. Auto-shutoff feature doesn't work well with small amounts of water.\n",
      "Good basic product, no frills, for use with your immersion blender.  Very satisfied with the purchase.\n",
      "Great smoothie cup.\n",
      "I use this when making Mayo. Works well with Cuisinart stick blender.\n",
      "Just like the ones in restaurants\n",
      "Solid, inexpensive - what more is there to say?\n",
      "Even though the volume size is the same as my as my Hamilton Beach drink mixer, it does not fit my machine\n",
      "Difficult to use. Garlic etc gets stuck and does not inject. I found the cheap plastic ones that come with marinates work a lot better than this.\n",
      "Nice solid material. Good control during usage. No complaints\n",
      "It does what it should, and works great\n",
      "\n",
      "but - I wish it would come with a pouch or container to hold all the parts when not in use. The simple cardboard box it came wrapped in is not good for this purpose.\n",
      "Restaurant quality and comes with two needles, one for pure liquid marinade and the other for those with bits of herbs/minced garlic. It even comes with spare gaskets for syringe. Outstanding!\n",
      "The needle bore is too large. Doesn't work for me.\n",
      "i love it.\n",
      "Excellent! Exactly as advertised. Very sturdy.\n",
      "In constant use now for years, the power switch is finally starting to give out (it disconnects before full boiling). Ordering a new one!\n",
      "I bought two of these - one for myself initially, and another for my Dad.  We both love them, and this is a very fast, convenient way to boil water for so many uses.  Works well, cleans easily and is VERY fast!\n",
      "It boiled a full pot of water (6 cups) in about 5 1/2 minutes.  It is fairly hard to see the water level on this, but it's something I can get used to.  The base is very lightweight, seems pretty cheap, and the lid remains attached, and also feels pretty flimsy.  Otherwise, it works well enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "** 12/7/13 update ** On the second use, the flimsy lid that I mentioned actually broke. I opened the lid to pour in water and the extremely cheap plastic flange that held it in place crumbled into 3 or 4 pieces. The lid still fits OK, just the hinge that holds it on broke. For that, I dropped it to 3 stars instead of 4.\n",
      "Does the trick for fast hot water.  There is a minor design flaw in that it is nearly impossible to see the fill marks.  If only they would add a little plastic ball that would float as it fills. But this problem isn't sufficient to lower my rating.  One other point that may not affect other users: because the heating element is within the kettle it does make it heavy, especially when filled with water.  I have arthritis and am especially weak in my hands and wrists so I leave it sitting on the stand and bring the water to it.\n",
      "I have been using this for more than a year and it works great. I make instant coffee and tea with it, and it is really nice to have in the room.\n",
      "Example of a simple machine that does its job: it heats water.  Enough power that it reaches a boil quickly.  Has a cut-off system built in.  Insert makes it easy to read the amount of water.\n",
      "I bought this kettle in 2009. It gets regular home use, ~6 boils per week. It's still working as well as it did on day one.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a pretty basic kettle. So there's not too much to love or hate, but I'm giving it 5 stars for these reasons:\n",
      "- it heats quickly, not noticeably faster or slower than any other kettle I've used.\n",
      "- the auto-shutoff works flawlessly (for me, I know other reviewers report problems).\n",
      "- it detaches easily from base, doesn't catch on any lips or anything.\n",
      "- it reattaches easily to the base, no fumbling around trying to guide it back on.\n",
      "- the handle doesn't get hot.\n",
      "- it has survived several drops.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only negative is that the top opening is a little small for a big hand to get inside to clean it. I think most hands would fit, but as a large-ish man, I have to use a bottle brush  though how often does one need to clean a kettle really.\n",
      "exactly as advertised.  Nice weight.\n",
      "Nice\n",
      "Very good companion for the hand blender.\n",
      "Good for making smoothie. Easy to clean.\n",
      "I've had this for a year now. I use it with my kitchenaid/juicer attachment to make grapefruit juice a couple times a month. There's never been any rust or any other problems, I always put it in the dishwasher, definitely would recommend.\n",
      "Does a great job injecting spice/flavorings into meat\n",
      "Good quality and does what it does. No complaints!\n",
      "better than expected\n",
      "I bought this for Thanksgiving turkey. After soaking the turkey in a salt brine over night, I then use this injector in addition to a baster throughout the cooking to keep my turkey moist. This is especially helpful for the breast, which as everyone knows can be a bit dry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Minus 1/2 a star for it sometimes being hard to move the plunger. When this happens I unscrew the cap and then put a little bit of oil (olive oil, turkey schmaltz, etc.) on the o-ring and this makes it easier.\n",
      "Great\n",
      "Great idea, but the marinade squirts out through the same hole.  I guess that's just the way flesh is.\n",
      "This replaces a plastic kettle that we had used for years. The Aroma kettle is fast and the hot water tastes good.\n",
      "Boils water rapidly, one of the best purchases we have bought for the kitchen.  Great for making french press coffee\n",
      "Good Product and easy to get hard water anywhere.  Second it can be use for lose tea leaves.  so we don't need to use the tea ball.\n",
      "Boils water easily and makes making tea very easy. It is easy to use and does not require a lot of maintenance.\n",
      "I bought this item based on the great customer reviews.  It does work well except for one thing- rust!  I happened to look inside the kettle and found rust on the bottom just under the spout.  They advertise this as being stainless steel, which obviously, it's not!\n",
      "Works as described\n",
      "Great product, use it every day, works nicely with my Immersion Blender, very easy to wash!\n",

      "Works Great!\n",
      "great, but have to be mindful of where one places their thumb when picking up and pouring. a little of the \"ouch hot\"\n",
      "This kettle works so fast! It's compact design is perfect for my small apartment. I love it. Do not over fill! It will boil over terribly.\n",
      "Loved this kettle although today it stopped working. Bought in Dec. 2010. So it lasted almost 3 years. You be the judge. May take it apart and see what I can see.  I had noticed a slight hot metal smell when using it the last couple weeks so perhaps the element has burned out. It was well used and will be missed.\n",
      "excellent material. We use it with our hand blender for quick mixes.\n",
      "Easy to clean! Perfect for my needs.\n",
      "ok\n",
      "When I drink out of these cups it tastes like metal or something. It leaves an awful taste in your mouth. I washed them over and over thinking maybe they had left over chemicals but they still are awful. I do not feel comfortable drinking out of these so I will not be using the cups. When I bought mine they were sold by McDonald Paper Restaurant Supplies. Good luck with yours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wrapped well but the cups still had scratches and scuff marks. I tested the metal with a magnet. It can barely stick to the lower portion of the cup but can stick to the upper portion. It also sticks better to the inside then the outside. So you have a stainless exterior and steel interior. Overall it is a nice cup.\n",
      "Nice, solid, and sturdy cups.  Great size for smoothies or shakes.  They keep cold longer than regular glasses/cups but they also get very cold on the outside.\n",
      "I really like this as it does a great job of injecting my juices into ham, unlike other injectors that the hole got blocked and and wouldn't go into meat.  My only drawback is it is so stiff to pull the handle back to pull the juices into the injector that I can't do it.  I have to have hubby pull it for me and even he is having difficulty doing it.  In fact, he ended up taking the end off and just pulling the juices up w/o the injector on it and then put the injector on the end.  I saw where people were talking about the gaskets getting lost of the end and I can see where that would be a problem as it is small.  However, they do send an extra gasket and they are easily replaced at the hardware store and not that expensive.\n",
      "Good gadget\n",
      "Work as advertised.  I use this product to inject brisket and it works fine.\n",
      "Excellent\n",
      "great\n",
      "Takes a bit getting used to. However does work as advertised.\n",
      "WOW! These are really the way to drink your cold beverages. Used mine as soon as I got them along with stainless steel straw. Truly a great drinking experience.  Get yours, you won't be disappointed . Sure beats sweating plastic or paper cups. These are 30 ounces perfect size fits in my car's cup holder (but of course all cars are different).\n",
      "I wish I had bought this sooner, it works great for large recipes being made with our stick blender. It washes easily. Love it! I am going to buy my mom one for her birthday with a stick blender!\n",
      "This works well for making smoothies using my stick blender - it's just the right size ans shape. My only 'con' with it is that after the first use and washing of it, there are a couple of rust spots on the inside of it. I thought one of the benefits of stainless steel is that it's not supposed to rust? At least not the first time you use it! So, not the best quality, but useful for what I purchased it for. So-So.\n",
      "Heavy weight ...exactly as represented.\n",
      "i make my protein shakes in this its perfect\n",
      "I absolutely LOVE the Aroma water kettle - it's still going strong after 2.5 years of moderate usage.  It's easy to fill, turns on with a simple press of the switch and know we'll have boiling hot water within a matter of a minute or two depending how full the kettle is filled.  If I forget and leave the kettle on the automatic shutoff is very reliable.  Just picking the kettle up off the base turns the unit off, or simply flip the switch back up.\n",
      "\n",
      "This Aroma water kettle is PERFECT for hot teas! I drink some herbal teas throughout the year but really rely upon them in the winter to help me warm, especially as the temperatures drop. Due to my crazy leg situation in the winter it just never feels like my leg is warm enough - drinking plenty of warm herbal teas helps me in this regard, especially if I add a pinch of turmeric or ginger or oregano.  It can also be used to heat water to boiling for making iced tea, jello desserts, etc. I have been known to make a homemade lemonade (warm in winter, iced in summer) using water heated in the water kettle, a fresh lemon and some sugar.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love this model Aroma water kettle so much that when I was seeking another for the office that I came back to the same model after reading the reviews on other similar models sold under by other brands. The initial price is slightly higher for the Aroma than other brands but the quality and reliability more than make up the difference by improved value.\n",

      "I would definitely purchase again, in fact undoubtedly I will be in the near future.\n",
      "The first pot we received was defective and actually looked a little different from the one pictured.  It was replaced without any hassle with the correct one and we are using it every day.  Good looking and works perfectly!  (I had bought it to replace another identical one that failed after a few years of constant several times a day use.)\n",
      "Outstanding kettle. VERY useful as I love to can and hot water is a MUST.\n",

      "Used for Thanksgiving Turkey that we fried.  Injected with marinade and the injector is heavy duty and had no issue piercing skin and meat of turkey.  Easy to clean, robust seals, it is a nice unit.  It is probably overkill and you could get away with the plastic injectors given away with most marinades, but I like to have tools that are top notch just in case.  So if you want a solid injector, get it.  If you plan on injecting a turkey or other meat every so often, you could save the money and use the plastic ones.\n",
      "Quit monkeying around with those expensive but cheaply built plastic injectors. This is much easier to use and way worth the money.\n",
      "Very sturdy, and with proper care should last almost forever. The injector needle with a number of holes along its length is great for brisket, roasts, and larger cuts. Points are VERY sharp, and I have never had the needles clog as with others I have used.\n",
      "If you need to boil water in a minute or so and don't have a gas or fire to prepare this for you this is the product you need to buy. Thanks\n",

      "I got this kettle about 2 weeks ago. I'm not sure if it is a design issue or just a faulty unit, but water started dripping from the bottom of the kettle the minute it boils for the very first time. I thought maybe because it's the first time so I continued using for a week or so. As long as the water is below the 1 Liter line, it works fine (although it takes too long after boiling to shut down automatically). But the minute the water is above the 1 Liter line, this thing dripped like a waterfall!! It's going back today\n",
      "A dear friend of mine has one just like it and the ease of boiling water for a cup of coffee makes this well worth every penny.\n",
      "It looks great on the counter and I especially like the feature which shows how much water is in the pot. Also, this one comes with a filter in the spout which is very useful if any impurities are in the water.\n",
      "Treat it gently and it will provide years of service. Do not push the start button with any force. Gently push down on it to begin the process of boiling water. Also remember to use this pot away from wood cabinets as the steam rising from the spout when boiling will swell the wood. Make certain it is out in the open.\n",
      "If you're thinking of getting one for yourself or as a gift for a friend then this is the one. I highly recommend it.\n",
      "This is a wonderful kettle for boiling water.  It's simple, super fast, & easy to clean.  As has been noted before, the heating coils are isolated from the water so there is no funny \"metallic/ electrical taste\" in the water. - makes it a lot easier to clean too!  Even the line cord is of a slightly heavier gauge compared to many of the kettles I've seen out there.  The handle is comfortable and cool to the touch.  Overall a very well made product.  I'm very satisfied with it.\n",
      "These are quite common in Europe where I frequent but since I live in the States, I had to buy this one on Amazon because it works  with 120 volts.  Overall, I'm ok with it.  Its a little slow to shut off and won't shut off unless the lit is fully closed.  Otherwise it is a pretty good design, but I've seen much better--just not here in the States.\n",
      "This is my favorite product. I bought my son and daughter one too. It is pretty, boils fast, holds a lot of water, pours nice, looks good, easy to clean. What more do you want in a hot pot? Oh, reasonable price. Using it  over a year, every day or even twice a day.\n",
      "I've used this for about a year with no issues.  And then this morning, the little tab that you use to turn on the kettle snapped off.  And it wasn't as if I suddenly turned into The Hulk due to lack of coffee and smashed it down hard.  No, just the usual push, then \"snap\".  Yes, I can still stick my fingernail onto the last bit of tab that's sticking out.  But I really wouldn't expect this to fail after just one year.  So I'm off to order the Chefman version, which has the on/off switch in the handle.  Hulk-proof design.\n",
      "VERY NICE MAN MANY USES\n",
      "Very sturdy. Excellent quality. I bought 2 to use with my immersion blender\n",
      "A wonderful SS cup for use with hand-held blenders. Only drawback on this one was that this seller took forever to ship, so will avoid buying from this seller again. Bought a second one from another seller and received it in two days, but now I got two of these identical cups and love them both. Both will get lots of use.\n",
      "This is a well made cup. I have had no issues with it. Not using it as much as I thought I would but thats not the cups fault. This is the same grade you would see in food service. Nice value!\n",
      "great\n",
      "it's great!!!\n",
      "Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he LOVES it!\n",
      "It works\n",
      "seems as all do the same.  I wouldn't pay more than 11.00 us dollars on crap like this.  BACTERIA COLLECTOR-----for safety 2015, enough said.\n",
      "Good stout injector but if you are using the needle with the holes, they plug up with coarse spices or pressed garlic.  I only use the straight needle now and that does work well.\n",
      "I drink tea daily and my husband enjoys using a french press for coffee each morning. We used a tea kettle on the stove which took MUCH longer and I would bet uses more electricity. Additionally, it took up a valuable range spot when cooking breakfast! This electric kettle is really compact, EXTREMELY easy to use (idiot proof really) and it looks nice out on the counter. We've only owned it for a couple of months and I hope it lasts - but even if it doesn't I won't be too upset because it was fairly inexpensive compared to other similar products.\n",
      "After 4 years of twice daily use our old Aroma stopped working,  I replaced it and the new one works as good as the old one.!\n",
      "I read the reviews and everything looked like it was a good addition to any household who likes a good cup of tea/coffee. Although I yet have to see. I just used it for the first time and worked great, turned off when water was ready and boiled the water in a blink! Let's see how long it lasts. Hopefully a long long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Design wise it is okay. I like the fact that it is cordless since I can lift off the kettle from the base to pour the water and that it has a clean look and for the price I really hope it doesn't tarnish or turns ugly. There is no smell of plastic at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just so people know, to be cordless doesn't mean there are not cables/cords involved . There isn't a \"blue tooth\" kind of connection for kettles yet, as far as I know. I'm saying this because on the reviews I read that some people complained about not being really cordless... Seriously? Hello! How do they expect it to be connected to the electric power I wonder...\n",
      "\n",
      "If something bad happens I'll write an update.\n",
      "I love this product.  Much faster than boiling water on the stove.  Easy to clean and it looks beautiful on my counter.  Would recommend this product to anybody who enjoys having tea, etc quickly especially in the morning.\n",
      "There really isn't much to say about a water kettle, but I picked this one out based on a friend's experience and I must say it fits the bill perfectly. It boils quickly, is cordless (the base plugs in, the kettle just rests on top), pours easy, and looks nice to boot. I bought this to go along with my Clever Coffee Dripper (&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/B00BFZ196S/dp/B00BFZ196S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">B00BFZ196S</a>&nbsp;) for making a quick cup of coffee in the morning. It works, and puts me at ease since this one has auto shut-off, so I can't leave the house with it still on. Highly recommend if it fits your use-case.\n",
      "Great cup to whip cream with my hand mixer and it's dishwasher safe. Easy to use and easy to clean plus it looks nice!\n",
      "One of these came leaking, unhappy.\n",
      "Does its job! Feels solid and heavy. Holds a lot of fruits and veggies when I make my smoothie. I bought this to use with my Cuisinart Immersion Blender.\n",
      "I love the size, going to be great for making mt shakes.\n",
      "This is a great product and bargain. I am never disappointed with my amazon purchases.\n",
      "Love It! ... & ... It was nicely packed!\n",
      "EXCELLENT ! ! ! ! !\n",
      "Works great. Well made. Combined with one of the hand-held electric stick mixers it is very easy to make real whipped cream or a milk shake at the spur of a moment without a major production. I have a couple of these and keep one in the freezer so it is ready. It is steel so there is a metallic taste if you choose to drink directly from the cup but it does not effect the contents.\n",
      "Has held up well with daily use, plastic kind crack and chip. Wrap with a towel or it can freeze your fingers.\n",
      "Prefer this to the plastic one that came with our Cuisinart CSmart Stick 2-Speed Immersion Hand Blender.  Cleans easily.  Well made.  Easy to hold on to.\n",
      "Cuisinart stick blender fits perfectly. I use it daily.\n",
      "Us this for making smoothies with my KitchenAid Hand  blender - Contour, it cleans up so easy.\n",
      "Arrived quickly and in great condition.\n",
      "Doesn't fit the Hamilton Beach DrinkMaster.\n",
      "I usually don't write reviews of items that have been heavily reviewed in the past. Everything has already been said. However I decided to write this because some people were complaining that you may lose the o-rings and only realize you've lost them when you need the syringe. The Item we got  comes with spare o-rings. If you tend to lose them in the dishwasher etc., chances are you'll lose the spare ones too. However these \"first\" spare ones allow you to continue using the syringe so you can order new ones in the meantime.\n",
      "Solid, functional, won't break. A great, dependable food processing must-have.\n",
      "Very durable item\n",
      "This is the best injection set I have ever owned. I do put it in the dishwasher and everything comes out clean even the needles. The store sent it out and it arrived a lot faster than I expected thanks a million. Jim & Laura.\n",
      "Great kettle with a small footprint on the counter. Heats quickly, never had a problem with off-taste in the water.\n",
      "I tried several other electric cordless kettles, this is the winner. No funky or plastic smell, super fast. Yes, the metal surface gets hot (it makes water boil!), just keep it out of reach of unexpecting \"touchers\", keep it out of reach of children.\n",
      "I only boil water in it, no coffee or tea inside it. If you make a lot of tea in small batches (gong fu style) this is a must have.\n",
      "If what you are looking for is the best... go for this one. It is beautiful to look at and heats the water very quickly.\n",
      "works good, just as described\n",
      "Does its job\n",
      "The product is very sturdy. After one use I washed and dried it. Now it is very difficult to push the plunger in. I don't think I'll use it again.\n",
      "Just what I needed for cooking in the smoker.\n",
      "This turntable does not turn-as you attempt to make it turn, it slides across the shelf.  The supports are now rectangular instead of the once thinner, round supports.  It might be easier to assemble (and cheaper to make) but easy and cheap just doesn't work or appeal to me. Spend a little more and get something that works if you plan on using it more than a few months as this is a throw-away.  Really disappointed, Rubbermaid!\n",
      "This was a gift for my daughter, she loved it and the price was so reasonable and the delivery was so fast, we couldn't believe it.\n",
      "thanks, Cindy\n",
      "This a very cheap looking kettle. Definitely doesn't look like it cost $30+. Another major flaw is that the lid doesn't open with a push of a button, you'd actually have to pull on that round thingy really hard to get the lid open. So, if the kettle is hot, you, most certainly, won't be able to do it. All and all, just a cheap looking thing.\n",
      "I ordered it after reading so many reviews, once I received it, and I gave it a try right away, this pot is awesome, so fast and convenient for using daily. I love it and I bought another one for my mother as a gift.\n",
      "Pretty simple review.  It does what its suppose to do: boil water.  It's a very nice pot with a good form factor.  Pours nicely.  Holds a good deal of water.  The on-switch is kind of odd - but it works.  It automatically cuts off when water has reached a boil - which is the important.  It is kind of nice you can just lift the pot off of its pad (no need to unplug from the put itself).  Been using this for months and it is solid.\n",
      "Since there were so many more good reviews than bad, and the worse reviews were a few years old, I took a chance with this kettle. I'm thinking that the problems first mentioned in the bad reviews have been taken care of. I own an inexpensive Aroma brand yogurt maker that has been in constant use every week for several years now and had been marvelous, so I thought I would go for their electric kettle as well. It is my first electric kettle, so I didn't want to spend too much money to figure out what worked best for me. I'm very pleased with this purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of all the things mentioned that were potentially bad about this Aroma Kettle, the only one we have noticed is the noise. It IS loud when heating up, but for me it's a good thing, because I often forget to plug it in and no noise is my indicator that I need to get over there and do it. It's not loud enough to wake up the grand baby, but it makes the dogs perk up from a sleep and I can hear it from two rooms away. Like I said, this is a plus for me because I usually set it up and leave the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have some nasty arthritis and this kettle being so light is a real plus and I don't look at it as a sign of cheapness. It is built solid, doesn't drip when pouring. The lid stays attached but opens all the way and has a catch that holds it open instead of flopping closed on you. It can't be filled from the fridge water dispenser, but I never use that anyway, (we keep open water jugs that have out-gassed of chlorine for coffee, tea, plants and doggies). I leave the lid open so it can dry out after use and have seen no rust.\n",
      "\n",
      "The water level indicator is located behind the handle and isn't that easy to see, but really, who cares. If it's that important you can see it or use a measuring cup. The handle is very comfortable for my arthritic hands and wrists, and placed well for balance.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish it had a longer cord, but it seems that none of them do. The cord length is 29\" and can be shortened by wrapping it in the underside of the base to the desired shorter length so you don't have excess cord on your counter.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some very expensive electric kettles out there and I am sure they are wonderful, but this Aroma Kettle is perfect for our use. It will get a real work out here, as we are a small inn, so I'll report back if I change my mind about this product in the future.\n",
      "With my new diet, I need to make several malt shakes a week.\n",
      "With this stainless steel glass works great for mixing and clean up.\n",
      "The perfect complement to the Cuisinart Smart Stick.\n",
      "sturdy\n",
      "Was a gift.\n",
      "This stainless steel mixing cup is very nice. My hand blender fits it perfectly and there is no splashing or dripping. It is comfortable to drink from and is very nice looking, its a good deal.\n",
      "Very nice would buy again.\n",
      "Great for meat junkies ;-)\n",
      "great\n",
      "This thing is solid, just lube up the plunger with some cooking spray or oil and you're good to go. This thing will last for years.\n",
      "I bought this for my husband and he loves it.  It is sturdy and allows for better seasoning injecting into turkeys, etc, because it holds up to spices that generally don't fit through smaller, plastic injectors.\n",
      "Great for making shakes\n",
      "Great for freezing ice blocks for iced tea.....!!!\n",
      "love using it with Cuisinart CSB-80 Smart Stick Power Trio High Torque Hand Blender\n",
      "Nice bonus.  Great service\n",
      "fair to the price and you will like it very good price but not bad product, you get what you paid, happy\n",
      "I was promoted, and I have my own office now. (Heck yah!) And I drink A LOT of tea - at least 2 brews a day. I love this kettle. It's quicker than the microwave and the water gets so hot! You can hear it start to boil, so you can stop it sooner if you like. I like the stand, so the cord is not attached to the kettle. The almost all metal interior means no plastic taste in your water (or bad chemicals). It pours nicely, and has a little bonus feature of a filter.\n",
      "\n",
      "12/15/14. This is still working great, and still gets heavy use. My office mate got a Keurig after I got this.. paid a ton more and yet they are often coming over to use my kettle because it works better for things like oatmeal and cup-o-soup. Sometimes simple is best. :-)\n",
      "This isn't the most stable turntable, but it works fine for what I need - and the size is right for my spice cupboard. It replaced one that I had had for may years - this one works much better and the rubber bases hold the spice bottles and prevent them from moving around.\n",
      "So much lip on the bottom tray and so much lip coming down from the top tray, that the lower tray isn't easy to use.\n",
      "Product arrived dirty, with hand prints all over it. Not something I'd want in my kitchen.\n",
      "The photo shows two needles, I recall only getting one.  That aside, this is a great cooking tool to get instant moisture, oil and flavor put deep into any raw protein.  It is solidly built and withstands the dishwasher.\n",
      "For large roasts, turkey, big chickens ,or thick steaks the injector works quite well .\n",
      "Fantastic... great buy at this price.\n",
      "Exactly what I was looking for. Works great and would recommend.\n",
      "This works fairly well. It heats water fast, and is fast and simple to use. The kettle just pulls right off of the stand, and can move around freely without having to unplug it or anything like that. There is a filter at it's mouth that makes pouring easy, but prevents water from splashing out.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it does not seem to differentiate between how much water is in the kettle and if it is already warm & just being reheated. It seems to use the same time and heating regardless, so often it overheats the water. The kettle also loses heat fairly quickly, so by the time you finish your first cup of tea (or whatever) you need to turn it back on. (It does not maintain temperature or anything like that, just turns off.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I am giving it 4 stars because, while not perfect, it is effective and affordable.\n",
      "Pretty useful, I will introduce to my friend.\n",
      "and all my family were use this to drink tea and hot water is hit it pretty fast.\n",
      "Pros\n",
      "Sleek design and it boils the water real quick\n",
      "It holds a lot of water and the heating pad makes it easy to maneuver\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons,\n",
      "The whole outside gets really hot when you are boiling water, which in some water kettles does not happen\n",
      "If this is sitting close to your stove, then beware the splatter marks and generally dirt the outside can attract.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am happy with the acquisition though and do recommend it. Aroma makes some good kitchen\n",
      "My aunt got this kettle for me a couple of years ago, and I love using it. I use it every day for tea, coffee, and even for the stovetop. I'll put a little water in a saucepan to start heating up, and the rest goes into the kettle since it's so much faster! It's also really great for \"setting the twist\" in my handspun wool. :)\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I have two small beefs with this kettle. First, the water where I live is so hard it practically has rocks in it, and the filter was not only totally made of plastic, but there were loose seams of the mesh that weren't secured to the edge. I threw it in my junk drawer, and thus the calcium flakes don't get filtered out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, the meter on the back is also made of plastic. Water gets up into the meter's cavity, and I feel like it can never get totally dry, which I don't care for.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, it's a great kettle.\n",
      "This turntable works great. I use it as a spice rack set up in a cabinet, and I am amazed -- it's so much easier to grab spices, and the cabinet looks so much cleaner. I was using one of those \"stairstep\" spice racks ... but spices in the back ended up getting lost and hard to reach. This turntable is so much better.\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple of notes:\n",
      "- This was super easy to put together ... like 5 seconds. The instructions were simple.\n",
      "- It spins flawlessly.\n",
      "- The non-slip surface keeps everything in place.\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple more notes if you're considering using it for spice jars:\n",
      "- This works great for spice jars about 3.75\" - 4\" tall. Easy in, easy out.\n",
      "- Spice jars that are 4.25\" take a tiny bit of tilting to get in/out of the bottom shelf.\n",
      "- I have one jar that is 4.75\" tall, and it takes a lot of twisting and turning to get in/out of bottom shelf. 4.75\" is probably the max height.\n",
      "- I have about 20 spice jars in total sitting on this\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, very happy with the turntable!\n",
      "This turntable/Lazy Susan is great! Its of good quality, turns smoothly, stable, durable and easy to put together. I foresee this being an occupant of my spice cabinet for many years to come. I've been looking for something like this for quite a while - quality, durability, ease of use and most importantly, AFFORDABLE! I'm so happy I found exactly what I was looking for!\n",
      "This turntable was packed well with no damage when I opened it. It arrived on time, as promised. I definitely got more than what I paid for!\n",
      "I have zero complaints and would definitely recommend this turntable to anyone looking for a welcome, sturdy addition to your cabinet(s)! If I had more room, I'd order more!\n",
      "Seem nice and sturdy. No poblems.\n",
      "Love them. Fit perfectly in our cabinets.\n",
      "cool\n",
      "it doesnt turn properly.  Lame design.\n",
      "I bought 2 of these.  After a year of use with one, the switch broke so I am unable to turn it on.  The other one just died and would not turn on when placed on the base.  Not very durable, these should last more than a year!\n",
      "I've had this for a year, use it every day. It's going strong.  Boils water very fast. Sometimes, I boil 6 or 7 pots in quick succession. Never a problem. I haven't used the tea kettle on the stove since I bought this.\n",
      "No complaints. Highly recommended.\n",
      "We've had our Aroma kettle for some years.\n",
      "It boils water quickly, like most others - that would not distinguish it in our experience.\n",
      "But it has developed serious problems, and we're about to retire ours because of these:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. It fails to shut off after boiling.  It will boil on and on for several minutes before shutting off (usually we get take it off the base before, sometimes remembering to manually shut it off).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. It fails to shut off when you take it off the powered base.  So when you pour out your hot water, then replace the kettle on its base, it will still be heating what little water might remain.  This seems a hazard.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The most irritating problem, also a hazard: when it boils water, some steam with condense in the top/handle hardware, and when you pour your water out, this scalding hot water will run out of the base of the kettle!  If you're unfamiliar with this, the water might drip on your feet or hands and burn you.\n",
      "There is always a puddle of water on and around the base, which is accumulated condensate that has run out of the base.  At first we thought this was due to a leak, but it is just steam condensing inside the top and handle.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The metal sides of the kettle get very hot and can burn you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, we would not recommend this product.  Some of the problems appear to be design defects, not parts failures.\n",
      "\n",
      "PS\n",
      "The level indicator window is all but useless when you're filling the kettle.  Your hand blocks the view of it, if you're holding kettle by the handle.  It's a minor issue for us, but might be important for others (why else would the kettle have this \"feature\"?).\n",
      "This pot came in very good quality. Very polished and no weird smells at all. The stainless steel looks great. It boils water very fast, but unfortunately, and the only thing I am disappointed about is that when the water boils, it does not cut off the power but keeps going. Wish this was different. Yet overall, I am very happy with it.\n",
      "This is a great kettle, but the bottom will show calcium deposits if you live in an area with hard water. (Be sure to follow the instructions and use water that's been filtered or bottled water. Also,don't let water that you didn't use sit in the pot for hours and hours.) My daughter lives in an area where water does not have to be treated as much as in my city and her Aroma pot is shiny and beautiful on the bottom.\n",
      "Despite that little problem I keep one Aroma at home and one at work and I love them because they work really well.\n",
      "The unit is great- water heats incredibly quickly.  However, I like to boil specific amounts of water, say 1 liter, and the location of the transparent part of the body which shows you water level is right behind the handle, which makes it really difficult to check while filling.  It's a silly quibble I have, but it annoys me each and every time I'm using the kettle.  If window were located elsewhere or were a little bigger, I'd give this a 5 star rating.\n",
      "I have used this about 6 times now. It works well and is great for really getting into the meat. Be careful when using the needle with the incremental holes. I didn't get them all under the meat and took a marinade shower but that was no fault of the product!\n",
      "Works very well. Highly recommended.\n",
      "This is a great flavor injector - way better than the plastic one that came with our Bayou Classic fryer. I knocked off a star, because was a little difficult to clean and cumbersome to handle as well. I think there need to be some work put into the design, but overall, it is a great product.\n",
      "great product\n",
      "My husband loves using his injector\n",
      "best injector for the money! and a great brand\n",
      "I hate to bring up the past but I swear that when I was young & had to have cavities removed that the dentist used a very similar syringe to inject novocaine. Is it just me? Anyways, what an absolute beast of an injector! Works fantastic on any meat you plan on injecting with off the shelf marinades or that wonderful concoction you have toiled over that will set the bar higher on that smoked turkey. Yum! I can testify about injecting a turkey & smoking it...slap your mama good. The injector introduces flavor all through the meat where traditional methods pale in comparison. If you are looking for a means to get more bang to your taste buds, this is a great avenue to venture down. The injector is rock solid & highly durable. Easy to take apart for cleaning.\n",
      "it was very good for my milk shakes.!!\n",
      "What's there to say, it's a cup.\n"
